        This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 concerning our current
expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the future. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information and are
subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of
risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. 
 
 
PART I     
 
  Item 1. Business.     
 
  General     
        Whole Foods Market is the world's leading natural and organic foods supermarket and America's first national "Certified Organic" grocer. Our Company mission is to
promote the vitality and well-being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Since the purity of our food and the health of our bodies are
directly related to the purity and health of our environment, our core mission is devoted to the promotion of organically grown foods, food safety concerns, and the sustainability of our entire
ecosystem. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over
the last 27 years. 
        Whole
Foods Market, Inc. is a Texas corporation incorporated in 1980. The Company is based in Austin, Texas and conducts business through various wholly owned subsidiaries. Unless
otherwise specified, references to Whole Foods Market or the Company in this Report include its consolidated subsidiaries. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. 
        We
opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and completed our initial public offering in January 1992. As of September 30, 2007, we operated 276 stores organized
into 11 geographic operating regions, each with its own leadership team: 263 stores in 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and six stores in the United Kingdom. This
includes 74 stores (net of divested locations) acquired from Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats") on August 28, 2007: 70 stores in 22 U.S. states and four stores in Canada. Unless
otherwise noted, all information in Part I of this Form 10-K is adjusted to include this acquisition. 
        Our
sales have grown rapidly through new store openings, acquisitions and comparable store sales growth, from approximately $92 million in fiscal year 1991, excluding the effect
of pooling-of-interests transactions completed since 1991, to approximately $6.6 billion in fiscal year 2007, a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 30%. We
are a Fortune 500 company, ranking number 411 based on our fiscal year 2006 sales of approximately $5.6 billion. Our 276 stores average approximately 34,000 square feet in size, approximately
$32 million in annual sales, and are approximately 8.2 years old. Excluding Wild Oats, our stores average 37,000 square feet in size, approximately $33 million in annual sales,
and are approximately 7.9 years old. Our stores are supported by 11 regional offices and our Austin headquarters, regional distribution centers, bakehouse facilities, commissary kitchens,
seafood-processing facilities, produce procurement centers, a national meat purchasing office, a confectionary, and a specialty coffee, tea procurement and brewing operation.

        We
aspire to become an international brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods, but also with being the best food retailer in every community in which we are located. We
believe our heavy emphasis on perishable products is helping us reach that goal, differentiating our stores from conventional supermarkets and enabling us to attract a broader customer base.
Perishable product sales accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales at Whole Foods Market locations in fiscal year 2007. We believe that all shoppers, not just natural and organic food
shoppers, appreciate great produce, dairy, meat, seafood, bakery and prepared foods, and it is our strength of execution in perishables along with our unparalleled customer service that has attracted
many of our most loyal customers. 
 
 
The Natural and Organic Products Industry     
        According to a leading trade publication for the industry, sales of natural products across all retail and direct-to-consumer channels
grew to approximately $57 billion in 2006, a 10% increase over the prior year. The natural and organic products we offer in our stores include food and beverages, dietary supplements, personal
care products, household goods, organic cotton clothing, and related educational products. We believe the growth in sales of natural and organic foods is being driven by numerous factors, including: 


•heightened
awareness of the role that food and nutrition play in long-term health, which has led to healthier eating patterns;
•a
better-educated and wealthier populace whose median age is increasing each year;
•increasing
consumer concern over the purity and safety of food due to the presence of pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and other chemicals, and
genetically engineered ingredients; and
•environmental
concerns due to the degradation of water and soil quality. 

        Natural
foods can be defined as foods that are minimally processed, largely or completely free of artificial ingredients, preservatives and other non-naturally occurring
chemicals and as near to their whole, natural state as possible. Organic products are grown through methods intended to support and enhance the earth's natural balance. Generally, organic food
products are produced using: 


•agricultural
management practices intended to promote and enhance ecosystem health;
•no
genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides;
•livestock
management practices intended to promote healthy, humanely treated animals by providing organically grown feed, fresh air and outdoor access while using no
antibiotics or growth hormones; and
•food
processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms ("GMOs") or synthetic
preservatives.

Organic Rule  
        In October 2002, the United States Department of Agriculture's ("USDA") Organic Rule was implemented into Federal law. The Organic Rule was created to
address the rapid, consistent growth of the organics industry over the past 20-plus years and the need for a set of national organic standards to serve as clear guidelines as to what is
considered organic for the industry and its customers. Under the Organic Rule, all products labeled as "organic" in any form must be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency.
Furthermore, all retailers, including Whole Foods Market, that handle, store, and sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic integrity by: 


•preventing
the commingling of organic and conventional products;
•protecting
organic products from contact with prohibited substances (such as sanitation and pest control products);
•labeling
organic products properly and clearly; and
•keeping
proper records with regard to organic handling procedures and vendor relationships. 

        Whole
Foods Market played an active leadership role in the development of the national organic standards. Margaret Wittenberg, our Vice President of Global Communications and Quality
Standards, served on the National Organic Standards Board ("NOSB") from 1995 to 2000. The NOSB members were appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to act as industry advisors to the USDA's National
Organic Program, developing the standards and protocols that form the backbone of the USDA's Organic Rule. As the sole retail representative on the NOSB, Ms. Wittenberg contributed a broad,
realistic perspective on how the standards could work most effectively at the retail level. 
        Whole
Foods Market has been devoted to protecting organic integrity for years, and we are pleased to have the USDA's Organic Rule as a guiding standard. In May 2003, Whole Foods
Market became America's first national "Certified Organic" grocer through certification from Quality Assurance International ("QAI"), a federally recognized independent third-party certification
organization. This voluntary certification tells our customers that we have gone the extra mile by not only following the USDA's Organic Rule, but following a strict set of operating procedures
designed to ensure that the products we sell and label as organic are indeed organic—procedures that are not specifically required by the Organic Rule. 
        QAI's
Organic Certification Program for Retailers verifies businesses handle organic goods according to stringent national guidelines, from receipt through re-packing to
final sale to customers. To receive certification, retailers must agree to adhere to a strict set of standards set forth by the USDA, submit documentation, and open their facilities to
on-site inspections—all designed to assure Americans that the chain of organic integrity is preserved. The certification is one more example of our commitment to the promotion
of organic agriculture and the integrity of the certified organic label. 
 
 
Business Strategy     
        Whole Foods Market is the world's leading natural and organic foods supermarket. We believe that much of our success to date is because we remain a uniquely
mission-driven Company. We are highly selective about what we sell. We believe in providing an empowering work environment for our team members, and we are committed to sustainable agriculture. Our
motto, "Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet," emphasizes that our vision reaches far beyond just food retailing. 
5



 

Whole Foods  
        We obtain our products locally and from all over the world, often from small, uniquely dedicated food artisans. We strive to offer the highest quality, least
processed, most flavorful and naturally preserved foods. We believe that food in its purest state, unadulterated by artificial additives, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives, is the best tasting
and most nutritious food available. 
Whole People  
        We recruit the best people we can to become part of our team. We empower them to make many operational decisions, creating a respectful workplace where team
members are treated fairly and are highly motivated to succeed. We look for team members who are passionate about food, but also well-rounded human beings who can play a critical role in
helping to build our Company into a profitable and beneficial part of every community in which we operate. 
Whole Planet  
        We believe companies, like individuals, must assume their share of responsibility for our planet. We actively support organic farming on a global basis because we
believe it is the best method for promoting sustainable agriculture and protecting the environment and farm workers. On a local basis, we are actively involved in our communities by supporting food
banks, sponsoring neighborhood events, and contributing at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to not-for-profit organizations. 
        In
October 2007, Whole Foods Market received the Green Power Partner of the Year award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") for the second consecutive year. The
award recognizes our leadership in accelerating the development of new renewable energy capacity nationwide after increasing our green power purchasing to include more than 509 million kilowatt
hours of wind-based renewable energy credits. This is enough renewable energy to offset 100 percent of the electricity used in all of our stores and facilities in the U.S. and
Canada. This was the fourth consecutive year the Company was recognized with a green power leadership award by the EPA. 
 
 
Core Values     
        Our core values reflect what is truly important to us as an organization. They are the underpinning of our corporate culture and the soul of our Company. They
transcend our size and growth rate, so regardless of how large we become, by maintaining our core values we are able to preserve what has always been special about our Company. Our five stated core
values include: 


•selling
the highest quality natural and organic products available;
•satisfying
and delighting our customers;
•supporting
team member happiness and excellence;
•creating
wealth through profits and growth; and
•caring
about our communities and our environment. 

        These
core values speak to our belief in a balanced way of doing business. They very succinctly express the purpose of our business, which is not only to make profits, but to create
value for all of our major stakeholders—our customers, team members, suppliers, investors, and the community and environment. All are linked interdependently. In 2007, Business Ethics
magazine ranked us number 54 on its "100 Best Corporate Citizens List for 2007," a list honoring companies that excel at serving a variety of stakeholders well.

Foundations  
        In 2005, we created two independent, non-profit organizations, the Animal Compassion Foundation™ and Whole Planet Foundation™,
designed to reach our larger community stakeholders. The two private foundations were initially funded with seed money totaling over $1 million raised from two global "Five Percent Days," in
which five percent of the amount of all customer purchases at our stores was donated to the foundations. Both foundations, which are based in Austin, Texas and have their own boards of directors, are
aligned with the mission we set forth more than 25 years ago with respect to community involvement and responsibility. As we have grown and are doing more business around the world, we believe
it has become increasingly important for us to extend our vision of "community" from our backyards to the global markets in which we are trading. 
        The
Animal Compassion Foundation was established as a natural progression of our efforts to help producers evolve their practices for raising farm animals naturally and humanely.
Dedicated to improving the lives of farm animals, the Animal Compassion Foundation seeks to learn and share best practices that support the animals' needs and behaviors by supporting a worldwide
network of producers and researchers, and leading and funding on-farm research and producer workshops. More specifically, the Animal Compassion Foundation is focusing on four primary
areas: 


•providing
research money for on-farm and academic studies;
•offering
low-cost producer workshops that provide both theoretical background and practical application;
•creating
an interactive website that allows online users to access species-specific case studies, animal husbandry techniques and strategies, and links to other resources;
and
•offering
consultative services to both individual groups and producer groups. 

        The
Whole Planet Foundation's mission is to create economic partnerships with the poor in the developing-world communities that supply our stores with product. Through innovative
assistance for entrepreneurship—including direct micro-credit loans and tangible support for other community partnership projects—the Whole Planet Foundation seeks to expand
the energy and creativity of every person with whom it works in order to create wealth and prosperity in emerging economies. Micro-credit is a system pioneered by Professor Muhammad Yunus, founder of
the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and recipient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The philosophy behind micro-credit is to provide the poor access to credit without requiring contracts or collateral,
enabling them to rise out of poverty through their own efforts. The Whole Planet Foundation believes micro-credit is one of the best methods to help individuals lift themselves out of poverty through
their own ingenuity. The Whole Planet Foundation is partnered with Grameen Trust in Costa Rica, Guatemala, India and soon Indonesia to support micro-lending programs in communities where the Company
sources products. The Whole Planet Foundation is also supporting micro-lending programs with other outstanding micro-finance institutions such as Adelante Foundation and Pro Mujer Nicaragua with hopes
to expand their portfolio to include other partners over time. 
7



 

        As
of September 30, 2007, the Whole Planet Foundation had committed over $5.2 million in grants to five micro-lending projects. These projects are in Costa Rica, where
Whole Foods Market sources bananas and pineapples; Guatemala and Nicaragua, where Whole Foods Market has relationships with coffee farmers; Honduras, where the Company sources bananas and buys coffee;
and India, where the Company buys tea. To date, the Whole Planet Foundation's implementing partners have supported over 14,000 micro-entrepreneurs and their families. It is estimated that each woman
with whom the foundation works in the developing world supports a family of five, which means our support is indirectly contributing to the prosperity of 70,000 individuals. Micro-entrepreneurs
supported by the Whole Planet Foundation's implementing partners are utilizing the loans for home-based businesses such as poultry and pig farming, agriculture, furniture making,
tailoring, and selling handicrafts, homemade and bakery-made foods, clothing and footwear. The Whole Planet Foundation hopes to expand its projects in 2008 to include micro-lending in
Indonesia, Kenya and Tanzania, where Whole Foods Market sources coffee through its Allegro Coffee Company. 
 
 
Products     
        We offer a broad and differentiated product selection with a strong emphasis on perishable foods designed to appeal to both natural and organic foods and gourmet
shoppers. Most of our products are from natural and organic food vendors; however, we do sell certain conventional national brands that meet our quality standards. 
Quality Standards  
        An integral part of our Company mission is to promote the vitality and well-being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome
foods available. We evaluate quality in terms of nutrition, freshness, appearance and taste. Our search for quality is a never-ending process involving the careful judgment of buyers throughout the
Company. 


•We
carefully evaluate each and every product that we sell.
•We
feature foods that are free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners and hydrogenated fats.
•We
are passionate about great tasting food and the pleasure of sharing it with others.
•We
are committed to foods that are fresh, wholesome and safe to eat.
•We
seek out and promote organically grown foods.
•We
provide food and nutritional products that support health and well-being. 

        We
monitor the production and environmental practices of our seafood suppliers and support the seafood sustainability work of the Marine Stewardship Council. From time to time, we have
stopped selling seafood species that are considered endangered by a consensus of seafood experts. 
        We
also strictly monitor how animals are raised and what they are fed. Our standards ensure the meat and poultry we sell are: 


•raised
without added growth hormones or antibiotics;
•never
fed animal by-products;
•raised
by farmers and ranchers who care about the animals and the environment in which they live; and
•closely
monitored from the farm to our stores to ensure compliance with our strict animal welfare and food safety quality standards.

Animal Welfare Standards  
        Whole Foods Market is strongly committed to helping create alternatives to the "factory farm" methods of raising livestock. We have encouraged innovative animal
production practices to improve the quality and safety of the meat and poultry sold in our stores, while also supporting humane living conditions for the animals. For this reason, we refuse to sell
commercial veal from tethered calves, foie gras from force-fed ducks and live lobsters. In February 2007, we began working with a vendor who meets our animal welfare standards, to
sell live lobsters in our Portland, Maine store. In December 2003, we started working through a consultative multi-stakeholder process to develop "Animal Compassionate" standards, farm animal
treatment standards that go above and beyond our baseline requirements for meat and poultry sold in our stores, focused on providing environments and conditions for each species that support the
animal's natural physical, emotional and behavioral well-being. In 2006, that work was then used as a basis for creating meat and poultry production standards categorized according to a
framework for continuous improvement of animal welfare on farms and ranches and to provide our customers with a clear and transparent way to make informed buying decisions based solely on animal
welfare considerations. In June 2007, we piloted a five-tiered meat and poultry labeling program at our Kensington store in London based on these standards, which we are currently
in the midst of fine-tuning and plan to roll out in the U.S. in 2008. Specific standards related to permissible and prohibited production and handling techniques from parent stock through
slaughter are intended to be included for the following species and related products: pigs, cattle, bison, broiler chickens, ducks, goats, rabbits, sheep, turkey, veal, dairy and eggs. 
Product Categories  
        Our product categories include, but are not limited to: produce, seafood, grocery, meat and poultry, bakery, prepared foods and catering, specialty (beer, wine
and cheese), Whole Body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, body care and educational products such as books), floral, pet products and household products. 
        Perishable
products accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales at Whole Foods Market locations in fiscal year 2007. We believe our heavy emphasis on perishable products
differentiates us from conventional supermarkets and helps us attract a broader customer base. We believe that all shoppers, not just natural and organic food shoppers, appreciate great produce,
dairy, meat, seafood, bakery and prepared foods. We believe it is our strength of execution in perishables that has attracted many of our most loyal customers. 
Locally Grown  
        Our history and reputation are intimately linked to our support of local farmers. For more than 27 years, we have provided our customers with the broadest
possible selection of the highest quality produce available. Our search for produce begins right outside our front door in every community where we do business. We are committed to buying from local
producers whose products meet our high quality standards, particularly those who are dedicated to environmentally friendly, sustainable agriculture. We are greatly increasing our efforts in this
regard by further empowering our individual store and regional buyers to seek out locally grown products. We value this natural diversity and have firm guidelines for using the term "local" in our
stores. For example, only produce that has traveled less than seven hours from the farm to our facility can be labeled "locally grown." 
9



 

        Whole
Foods Market currently purchases produce from over 3,000 different farms through various suppliers. Of the Company's top 10 produce suppliers, eight represent independent farms
with privately held ownership. We believe we can and should do more to support local producers. To that end, we have established a budget of up to $10 million annually to promote local
agriculture, especially animal agriculture, wherever we have stores through long-term loans at low interest rates. We completed our first loan through the Local Producer Loan Program in
February 2007 and so far have disbursed more than $1 million in loans to over 20 local producers in nine of our 11 regions. Loan recipients must use funds for expansion and not operating
expenses, meet Whole Foods Market's quality standards, and have a viable business plan and adequate cash flow to service the debt. Eligible products include agricultural crops, value-added food
products, and other all-natural grocery items. 
        In
addition, at stores in five of our 11 regions, we are now providing space in our parking lots weekly for local farmers to sell their products directly to our customers, working in
concert with existing farmers' markets when possible. Our stores have excellent locations and heavy customer traffic to help these farmers' markets flourish, and their presence at our stores provides
more local choices for our customers. 
Whole Trade™  
        On March 29, 2007, we launched our Whole Trade program, a new buying initiative that brings together a set of strict criteria for products from developing
countries to ensure: exceptional product quality; more money for producers; better wages and working conditions for workers; sound environmental production practices, and support of poverty
eradication via donating 1% of product sales to the Whole Planet Foundation. 
        The
Whole Trade program gives low-income producers entry into and stability within the global marketplace by ensuring better wages and safer working conditions for workers.
It supports equitable systems of trade that are an investment in both farms and communities. Through the Whole Trade program, Whole Foods Market seeks out and promotes foods that are grown using sound
environmental practices that encourage biodiversity and healthy soils. In addition to including some products that are grown organically, the Whole Trade program includes products that respect the
earth without formal organic certification. These products could be sourced in two ways. Some come from farms that use integrated pest management systems, emphasizing alternatives to chemical use;
they also practice soil and water conservation through composting and reforestation. Other products are respectfully harvested from land or water areas that provide shelter and habitat for migratory
birds and other species. 
        Our
Whole Trade Guarantee label is currently featured on more than 400 items, and sales of nearly $8 million to date have generated approximately $80,000 for the Whole Planet
Foundation. Our goal is to have more than 50% of our imported products from developing countries meet Whole Trade qualifications within 10 years. 
Private Label  
        An extension of our leadership position in the natural and organic foods industry is our strong family of private label brands. These products extend the
confidence and trust our customers have in our stores to their everyday lives. We've built upon this trust and over the last several years have significantly expanded our private label resources and
offerings, which currently feature over 2,000 SKUs led by our primary brands, 365 Everyday Value and 365 Organic. 
        In
addition to these nationally-driven programs, we have a number of store-made and regionally-made fresh items sold under the Whole Foods Market label. We also
offer specialty and organic coffee, tea and drinking chocolates through our Allegro Coffee Company subsidiary.

•365 Everyday Value. In 1997, we introduced a line of products under the "365" label emphasizing everyday value. These
products meet our quality standards but are generally less expensive than the alternative products we sell. Our qualitative and quantitative research indicates that the "365" line is a highly
recognized and trusted brand with Whole Foods Market shoppers.
•365 Organic Everyday Value. In 2002, we expanded our private label program with the introduction of our "365 Organic" line.
The "365 Organic" brand provides all of the benefits of organic food at reduced prices. In 2003, we expanded this program into non-grocery departments, including a successful line of
organic fresh vegetables, and in 2006, we began the process of rebranding our Whole Kids Organic line, first introduced in 1998, under the "365 Organic" label with some new kid-friendly
designs.
•Whole Brands. In 2004, we introduced a new family of "Whole Brands," each aligned with department-specific quality and
sourcing standards. Included under the "Whole Brands" umbrella are "Whole Kitchen" for pre-packaged fresh and frozen grocery, "Whole Treat" for frozen desserts, cookies and candies, "Whole
Catch" for pre-packaged fresh and frozen seafood items, "Whole Fields" for produce and produce support items, "Whole Pantry" for items such as herbs, spices and condiments, "Whole
Creamery" for cheeses, "Whole Ranch" for pre-packaged fresh and frozen meat, and "Whole Paws" for tasty and healthful pet food. These brands go beyond the basics, offering unique items,
including innovative formulations, that embody our high quality standards and supplement our base value line of "365" and "365 Organic" items. Items within "Whole Brands" share a consistent logo
format and packaging so that our customers know each is part of a greater family. 

        At
our Whole Foods Market locations, private label sales in grocery and nutrition accounted for approximately 18% of our total retail sales in those product categories in fiscal year
2007, up from 16% in fiscal year 2006. Total private label sales across all teams accounted for approximately 9% of our retail sales in fiscal year 2007, up from 8% of our retail sales in fiscal year
2006, reflecting the roll-out of approximately 550 new items in fiscal year 2007. We believe our private label sales could grow to a much higher percentage of our sales over time, as we
continue to focus on the rapid development and growth of our product lines. 
 
 
Economic Value Added     
        We use Economic Value Added ("EVA"™) as a basis for our business decisions and for determining incentive compensation. In its simplest definition, EVA
is equivalent to net operating profits after taxes minus a charge for the cost of invested capital necessary to generate those profits. We believe one of our core strengths is our decentralized
culture, where decisions are made at the store level, close to the customer. We believe this is one of our strongest competitive advantages and that EVA is the best financial framework that team
members can use to help make decisions that create sustainable shareholder value. 
        We
use EVA extensively for capital investment decisions, including evaluating new store real estate decisions and store remodeling proposals. We only invest in projects that we believe
will add long-term value to the Company. The EVA decision-making model also enhances operating decisions in stores. Our emphasis is on EVA improvement, as we want to challenge our teams to
continue to innovate and grow EVA in new ways. We believe that opportunities always exist to increase sales and margins, to lower operating expenses and to make investments that add value in ways that
benefit all of our stakeholders. We believe that focusing on EVA improvement encourages continuous improvement of our business.

        Over 750 leaders throughout the Company are on EVA-based incentive compensation plans, of which the primary measure is EVA improvement. EVA-based plans cover our
senior executive leadership, regional leadership and the store leadership team (store team leaders and assistant store team leaders) in all stores. Incentive compensation for each of these groups is
determined based on relevant EVA measures at different levels, including the total Company level, the regional level, the store or facility level, and the team level. We believe using EVA in a multi-
dimensional approach best measures the results of decisions made at different levels of the Company. We expect EVA to remain a significant component of our compensation structure throughout the
Company in the coming years. 
        Information
about our EVA financial results is not presented because of rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding non-GAAP financial measures.

Acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc.     
        On August 28, 2007, we completed the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc., a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America, in a
cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million plus the assumption of approximately $148 million in existing debt. To fund the transaction, we entered into a
five-year $700 million senior term loan agreement. We also signed a new five-year $250 million revolving credit agreement, which replaced our existing
$200 million line of credit. 
        At
the time of our acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores in 23 states and British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats Marketplace (nationwide), Henry's Farmers
Market (in Southern California), Sun Harvest (in Texas), and Capers Community Market (in British Columbia). All of our 11 operating regions gained stores, with our three smallest regions, the Florida,
Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions, gaining critical mass. The acquisition provided us with immediate entry into five new states: Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah, and 15 new
markets: Bend, OR; Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Lexington, KY; Little Rock, AR; Melbourne, FL; Memphis, TN; Naples, FL; Nashville, TN; Reno, NV; Salt Lake City, UT; Tampa, FL; Tucson, AZ; Tulsa,
OK; and Westport, CT. 
        On
September 30, 2007, we completed the sale of all 27 Henry's Farmers Market and eight Sun Harvest store locations and a related Riverside, CA distribution center to a wholly
owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer. Subsequent to year-end, the Company received proceeds of approximately $165 million for the
net assets of those stores, consisting primarily of fixed assets, inventory, and operating leases. Additionally, Whole Foods Market and Smart & Final entered into a transition services
agreement under which Whole Foods Market will continue to provide certain general and administrative services for the 35 stores for up to two years. We currently anticipate that the revenue associated
with this agreement will be approximately equal to our incremental cost of providing the support. 
        Subsequent
to year-end, we closed eight Wild Oats stores in Portland, OR; Tualatin, OR; Matthews, KY; West Vancouver, Canada; Mission, KS; Littleton, CO; Omaha, NE; and
Saugus, MA. We also temporarily closed the Wild Oats store in Medford, MA for a major renovation; the store is scheduled to re-open in the spring of 2008. In addition, the Wild Oats stores
in Nashville, TN and Pasadena, CA were relocated to new Whole Foods Market stores in early November 2007. Net of these closures and relocations, the Company had 63 Wild Oats and Capers
locations on November 20, 2007, with plans to close one additional Wild Oats store in Portland, ME in fiscal year 2008. The Company also plans to relocate seven Wild Oats stores in British
Columbia, Canada; Littleton, CO; Naples, FL; Indianapolis, IN; St. Louis, MO; Reno, NV; and Salt Lake City, UT as the Whole Foods Market stores currently in development open in those areas.

Growth Strategy     
        Whole Foods Market's growth strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and acquisitions of existing stores. We have a disciplined,
opportunistic real estate strategy, opening stores in existing trade areas as well as new markets, including international markets. Our new stores typically range in size between 45,000 and 60,000
square feet and are located on premium real estate sites. We have also grown through acquisitions, with approximately 32% of our existing square footage coming from acquisitions. Because the natural
and organic foods retailing industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many smaller local and regional chains, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of smaller chains that provide access to
desirable markets, locations and experienced team members. Going forward, however, such acquisitions are not expected to impact our future store growth or financial results due to the size of the
Company's existing store base. 
13



 

        We
have an ongoing relocation strategy and actively relocate some of our smaller stores to larger locations with improved visibility and parking each year. For stores relocated in fiscal
years 2003 through 2007, the overall average increase in size was approximately 121%. Our historical store growth is summarized below:

        As
of November 20, 2007, we had signed leases for 87 stores scheduled to open through fiscal year 2010 totaling approximately 4.5 million square feet, or approximately 48%
of our existing square footage. These stores, which average approximately 51,000 square feet in size and are roughly 48% larger than the average size of our existing store base, include 22 relocations
and 14 new markets. Our historical growth in stores in development is summarized below:

        We
have continued to sign and open smaller stores, typically in markets where it is hard to develop larger sites, while experimenting with opening some very large format stores. We
currently operate nine stores in excess of 65,000 gross square feet and have an additional 13 stores of that size in development, seven of which are relocations. On average, we are pleased with the
results of these larger format stores, as we believe they will deliver strong returns over time as they appeal to a broader customer base, take longer to reach capacity, and create a higher barrier to
entry, making them less vulnerable to competition. We plan to continue to selectively sign larger sites, which showcase extensive prepared foods and sit-down venues, but going forward, we
expect them to be predominantly in dense urban markets or relocations of some of our very successful existing stores. 
        As
shown in the table above, our total gross square footage and average size of stores in development were lower in fiscal year 2007 than in fiscal year 2006. This was due primarily to
two factors: more stores exiting the development pipeline as the acceleration in our new store openings materializes, and a decrease in the average size of new leases signed during the year. 
        Tender
dates provide some visibility on the timing of our new store openings. For accounting purposes, a lease is considered tendered on the date we take possession of the leased space
for construction and other purposes, which is typically when the shell of the store is complete or close to completion. As of November 20, 2007, 20 of our 87 stores in development had been
tendered to us. These 20 stores represent approximately 916,000 square feet. 
        The
"tender period," which we define as the length of time between a store's tender date and opening date, varies depending on several factors, some of which are outside of our control.
These factors include the size of the store and complexity of site development, the impact of weather and unforeseen environmental issues, and issues surrounding construction labor unions and local
government authorities, among other things. Furthermore, acquired leases, ground leases and owned properties generally have longer tender periods than standard operating leases because we take
possession of these locations earlier in the construction process. For stores opened during the past three fiscal years, the average tender period was 8.7 months.

Site Selection  
        Most of our stores are located in high-traffic shopping areas and are either freestanding or in a strip center. We also have a number of urban stores
located in high-density, mixed-use projects. In selecting store locations, we use an internally developed model to analyze potential markets based on various criteria such as
education levels, population density and income levels within certain drive times. We primarily seek to open large-format stores, which typically range in size between 45,000 to 60,000 square feet and
are located on premier real estate sites, often in urban, high-population locales. After we have selected a target site, our development group does a comprehensive site study and sales
projection. Each project must meet an internal EVA hurdle return, which is generally cumulative positive EVA within seven years. 
        The
required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development
issues. For stores opened during the past two fiscal years excluding Kensington, the average size was 52,700 square feet and our new store investment averaged approximately $14.4 million
excluding pre-opening and relocation expenses, which averaged approximately $2.4 million per store.

Store Operations     
Team Approach to Store Operations  
        We strive to promote a strong Company culture featuring a team approach to store operations that we believe is distinctly more empowering of employees than that
of the traditional supermarket. Our domestic Whole Foods Market stores each employs between 85 and 600 team members who comprise up to 13 teams per store, each led by a team leader. Each team within a
store is responsible for a different product category or aspect of store operations such as customer service, prepared foods, or grocery, among others. Just as we have a regionally-focused framework,
we also promote a decentralized team approach to store operations in which many decisions are made by teams at the individual store level. In this structure, an effective store team leader is critical
to the success of the store. The store team leader works closely with one or more associate store team leaders, as well as with all of the department team leaders, to operate the store as efficiently
and profitably as possible. Twice yearly, our team members are asked to complete a confidential, third party-administered team leader survey, which provides them with an opportunity to give their
leaders constructive feedback. 
        We
believe our success is dependent on the collective energy and intelligence of all of our team members. We strive to create a work environment where motivated team members can flourish
and reach their highest potential, and where they are inspired by work that provides them with a greater sense of purpose and mission. For many team members, their job is an extension of their
personal philosophy and lifestyle. Together, we go to great lengths to satisfy and delight our customers. 
        Team
members are involved at all levels of our business. We strive to create a Company-wide consciousness of "shared fate" by uniting the interests of team members as closely
as possible with the interests of our shareholders. One way we reinforce this concept is through gainsharing. Our gainsharing program rewards things such as labor productivity that team members can
control, giving them a direct stake in the success of our business. We also encourage stock ownership among team members through the following programs: 


•Team
Member Stock Option Plan. All full-time and part-time team members are eligible to receive a grant of stock options each year. The annual grant
has two components: (i) Annual Leadership Grants to recognize and incentivize team member performance; and (ii) Service Hour Grants to recognize team member service to the Company. In
2007 our Board of Directors awarded approximately 1.7 million options to more than 13,400 team members. Of these stock options, 95% were granted to non-executives, with 47% awarded
as Service Hour Grants alone.
•Team
Member Stock Purchase Plan. Through bi-weekly payroll deductions, all U.S.-based non-seasonal team members with at least 400 service hours may
elect to purchase unrestricted shares of our stock at 95% of market value on the purchase date. The shares are purchased for the plan participants on a quarterly basis. Approximately 2,000 team
members currently participate in this plan.
•Team
Member 401(k) Plan. Whole Foods Market stock is an investment option within the Company's 401(k) plan.

Store Description  
        We do not have a standard store design model. Instead, each store's design is customized to fit the size and configuration of the particular location and
community in which it is located. Our culture and philosophy is one of continual innovation and experimentation, and successful experiments are voluntarily picked up and improved upon by our stores
and regions. We strive to transform food shopping from a chore into a dynamic experience by building and operating stores with colorful décor, well-trained team members,
exciting product mixes, teams of in-store chefs, ever-changing selections, samples, open kitchens, scratch bakeries, hand-stacked produce, prepared foods stations
and European-style charcuterie departments. To further a sense of community and interaction with customers, our stores typically include sit-down eating areas, customer comment boards and
customer service booths. We have "Take Action" centers for our customers who want to be informed on important issues relative to environmental, legislative, food safety and product quality issues that
can directly affect our customers' health and well-being. In addition, some stores offer special services such as massage, valet parking and home delivery. We believe our stores play a
unique role as a third place, besides the home and office, where people can gather, interact and learn while at the same time discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food. 
 
 
Purchasing and Distribution     
        Our buyers purchase products for retail sale from local, regional, national and international wholesale suppliers and vendors. The majority of our purchasing
occurs at the regional and national levels. This enables us to negotiate better volume discounts with major vendors and distributors, while allowing our regional and store buyers to focus on local
products and the unique product mix necessary to keep a neighborhood market feel in our stores. We are increasingly focusing more of our purchasing on producer-direct and manufacture-direct programs,
and we remain committed to buying from local producers that meet our high quality standards. 
        We
own two produce procurement centers which facilitate the procurement and distribution of the majority of the produce we sell. We also operate a national meat purchasing office, a
confectionary, four seafood processing and distribution facilities, a specialty coffee and tea procurement and brewing operation, and nine regional distribution centers, which distribute a full range
of products to our stores across the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have five regional commissary kitchens and 11 bakehouse facilities, all of which distribute products to our
stores. Other products are typically procured through a combination of specialty wholesalers and direct distributors. 
        United
Natural Foods, Inc. is our single largest third-party supplier, accounting for approximately 24% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2007. In November 2006, we
extended our long-term relationship with United Natural Foods as our primary supplier of dry grocery and frozen food products. Our seven-year agreement allows us to concentrate
our capital and resources on executing on our new store development pipeline and to focus our internal distribution efforts around key perishable departments including produce, prepared foods, bakery,
seafood and meat. 
18



 

 
 
Marketing     
        We spend much less on advertising and marketing than conventional supermarkets—approximately 0.5% of our total sales in fiscal year 2007. Instead, we
rely primarily on word-of-mouth recommendations and testimonials from our shoppers, as well as the publicity and excitement generated by our new store openings. We allocate our
marketing budget among region-wide programs, our individual stores' marketing efforts, and a national brand awareness initiative focusing primarily on national in-store
marketing programs and national and major-market public relations. Our stores spend most of their marketing budgets on in-store marketing-related activities, including signage and
in-store events such as taste fairs, classes, tours and product samplings. To create goodwill and develop a high profile within the community, each store also has a separate budget for
making contributions to a variety of philanthropic and community activities. We presently contribute at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to
not-for-profit organizations. 
 
 
Customer Service     
        Customers are our most important stakeholder, because without our customers, we would have no business. We genuinely care about the well-being of our
customers and empower our team members to do whatever it takes to meet or exceed their expectations on every shopping trip. By doing so, we turn our customers into advocates for our business, who do
more than shop with us; they recommend Whole Foods Market to their friends and others. We want to serve our customers competently, efficiently, and knowledgeably. We believe that we generate greater
appreciation and loyalty from our customers by educating them about natural and organic foods, health, nutrition and the environment through our in-store "Take Action" centers as well as
on our corporate website at www.wholefoodsmarket.com, which features hundreds of recipes and a library of information about environmental, legislative, food safety, and product quality issues. 
 
 
Team Members     
        As of September 30, 2007, we had approximately 52,600 team members, including approximately 44,900 full-time, 5,200 part-time and
2,400 temporary team members. Of the total, approximately 6,000 were Wild Oats Markets team members, including approximately 3,700 full-time, 2,000 part-time and 300 temporary
team members. We are proud that 90% of our permanent team members are full-time team members, which we believe is very high for the food retailing industry and allows us to better serve
our customers. 
        One
of our core values is supporting team member happiness and excellence, and we believe our innovative and egalitarian work environment with team members involved at all levels of our
business is a major reason for our success. We believe happy team members create happy customers, and happy customers create happy investors. Team members who have a voice in shaping the direction of
our Company and their future are empowered to make Whole Foods Market not only a great place to shop but a great place to build a career. All of our full-time and part-time
team members are eligible to receive stock options. In addition, team members are encouraged to take an active role in choosing the benefits made available by the Company by participating in a
Company-wide benefits vote every three years. The Company's second vote was held in fiscal year 2006 to determine the benefits program that will be in place from 2007 through 2009.
Approximately 77% of eligible team members voted in this important process, resulting in a benefits package that reflects the needs and desires of the majority of team members in the Company. One
outcome of the vote is that Whole Foods Market provides healthcare at no cost to eligible full-time team members. Eligible full-time team members are those who work 30 or more
hours per week and have worked a minimum of 800 service hours. Dependent healthcare premiums are shared based on a team member's tenure with the Company; the team member's share decreases as his/her
tenure increases. 
19



 

        For
the past 10 years, our team members have helped Whole Foods Market become one of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work for in America." In scoring companies, Fortune
places the greatest weight (two-thirds of the total) on responses to a random survey of 400 employees, with the remainder being Fortune's evaluation of each company's credibility, respect,
fairness and pride/camaraderie. Ranking number five in 2007, our highest ever, we are one of only 18 companies to make the "100 Best" list for 10 consecutive years since its inception. 
 
 
Competition     
        Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies from region to region and includes but is not limited to local, regional,
national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, other natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, smaller specialty stores, and restaurants, each of which competes with us on
the basis of product selection, quality, customer service, price or a combination of these factors. We believe our commitment to natural and organic products, high quality standards, our focus on
customer service, and our competitive prices on comparable products differentiates us in this segmented marketplace. 
        Natural
and organic food is one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Most supermarkets offer at least a limited selection of these products, while some have chosen to
expand their selection more aggressively. We believe it works to our benefit for conventional supermarkets to offer natural and organic products for two reasons: first, it helps fulfill our Company
mission to improve the health, well-being and healing of both people and the planet, and second, it helps create new customers for us by creating a gateway experience. As more people are
exposed to the benefits of natural and organic products, we believe they are more likely to become Whole Foods Market customers since we are the category leader for natural and organic products,
offering the largest selection and most informed customer service at competitive prices. 
        Competition
makes us a better retailer. We are constantly evolving, innovating and maturing, and we have a long track record of responding to and improving with competition. We believe
we are better positioned from a value and price perspective today than we ever have been. Our buy-side initiatives are continuing to deliver opportunities that will allow us to be more
price competitive, and we are leveraging our global buying power to the benefit of our customers. On the sell side, our innovation will accelerate over the next few years as we continue to redefine
the marketplace and further differentiate our stores, products, and customer experience from the competition. 
        We
believe our strong comparable store sales growth, which historically has been significantly higher than the industry average, is evidence of this gateway experience and of our ability
to evolve faster than our competition. 
 
 
Government and Public Affairs     
        Our stores are subject to various local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply
with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages. 
20



 

        The
manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the Food and Drug
Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and the EPA. The composition and
labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act ("FFDC Act"). The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years
with respect to dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. We believe we are in material compliance with product labeling
requirements.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.     
        We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by
forward-looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the SEC, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral
forward-looking statements made from time to time by representatives of the Company. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Additional risks and
uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. 
23



 

Our Growth Is Significantly Dependent on New Store Openings and Acquisitions  
        Our strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions of existing store locations or businesses. Successful
implementation of this strategy is contingent on numerous conditions, some of which are described below, and there can be no assurance that this expansion strategy can be successfully executed. 
        Our
continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new markets and to operate these stores successfully. Our expansion
strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations, and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites. There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through new store
openings and/or acquisitions. We may not be able to timely open new stores or operate them successfully. Also, we may not be able to successfully hire and train new team members or integrate those
team members into the programs and policies of the Company. We may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores
at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner. 
We May Not Be Able to Successfully Integrate Acquired Businesses into Our Operations  
        We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations and support systems, or the operations of acquired businesses may be
adversely affected by the introduction of our decentralized operational approach. Also, the integration of acquired operations into our operations requires the dedication of management resources that
may temporarily detract attention from our day-to-day business. 
New Stores May Negatively Impact Our Results  
        There can be no assurance that our new store openings will be successful or result in greater sales and profitability for the Company. New stores build their
sales volumes and refine their merchandise selection over time and, as a result, generally have lower gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales than our more mature stores.
As we accelerate our rate of new store openings, thus increasing the percentage of our sales from new stores and decreasing the average age of our store base, there may be a negative impact on our
results from a lower contribution of these new stores, along with the impact of related pre-opening and relocation costs. 
We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Comparable Store Sales  
        Our comparable store sales could fluctuate or be lower than our historical average for many reasons including new and acquired stores entering into the comparable
store base, the opening of new stores that cannibalize store sales in existing markets, increased competition, price changes in response to competitive factors, possible supply shortages, and cycling
against several years of above-average sales results. Our results of operations may be materially impacted by fluctuations in our comparable store sales as the result of lower sales, lower gross
profits and/or greater operating costs such as marketing. 
24



 

We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Quarterly Operating Results  
        Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate for many reasons, including losses from new stores, variations in the mix of product sales, price changes in
response to competitive factors, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, increases in store operating costs, possible supply shortages, extreme weather-related disruptions, including hurricanes
and earthquakes, and potential uninsured casualty losses or other losses. In addition, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as the result of the timing of new store openings and
pre-opening costs, the timing of acquisitions, store closures and relocations and the range of operating results generated from newly opened. Quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings. 
Increased Competition May Have an Adverse Effect on Profitability  
        Our competitors include but are not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, other natural food stores,
warehouse membership clubs, small specialty stores and restaurants. These businesses compete with us in one or more product categories. In addition, some are expanding more aggressively in marketing a
range of natural and organic foods, thereby competing directly with us for products, customers and locations. Some of these potential competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater
financial or marketing resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. As competition in certain markets intensifies, our results of
operations may be negatively impacted through a loss of sales, reduction in margin from competitive price changes, and/or greater operating costs such as marketing. 
Our Business May be Sensitive to Economic Conditions that Impact Consumer Spending  
        Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future
economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, tax rates, fuel and energy costs, the impact of natural disasters or acts of
terrorism, and other matters could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to lower-priced competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts
in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability. 
Legal Proceedings Could Materially Impact Our Results  
        From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property,
acquisitions, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the FTC is currently pursing an administrative proceeding concerning our recent acquisition of Wild Oats
Markets. Our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings. 
We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People Are Harmed By the Products We Sell  
        There is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. We believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of their
interest in health, nutrition and food safety. We believe that our customers hold us to a higher food safety standard than conventional supermarkets. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food
products by us could result in product liability claims, the settlement or outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations. 
25



 

The Loss of Key Management Could Negatively Affect Our Business  
        We are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we were to lose the services of a significant number of key team members within a
short period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member. Our continued success is also dependent upon our ability
to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We face intense competition for qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing employers. We
may not be able to attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business. 
Unions May Attempt to Organize Our Team Members  
        Unions have from time to time attempted to organize all or part of our team member base at certain stores and non-retail facilities. Responding to
such organization attempts is distracting to management and team members and may have a negative financial impact on a store, facility or the Company as a whole. 
Unfavorable Changes in Government Regulation Could Harm Our Business  
        Our stores are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must
comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages. Our new
store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. 
        The
manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the FDA, FTC, CPSC, USDA and
EPA. The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the FFDC Act. The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to
dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. 
        The
USDA's Organic Rule, implemented into federal law on October 21, 2002, facilitates interstate commerce and the marketing of organically produced food and provides assurance to
our customers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with this rule could pose a significant burden on some of our suppliers, which may cause a disruption in some of our
product offerings. 
        We
cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders,
when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet
new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or
different labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
26



 

A Widespread Health Epidemic Could Materially Impact Our Business  
        The Company's business could be severely impacted by a widespread regional, national or global health epidemic. Our stores are a place where customers come
together, interact and learn while at the same time discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food. A widespread health epidemic may cause customers to avoid public gathering places or otherwise
change their shopping behaviors. Additionally, a widespread health epidemic could also adversely impact our business by disrupting production and delivery of products to our stores and by impacting
our ability to appropriately staff our stores. 
Changes in the Availability of Quality Natural and Organic Products Could Impact Our Business  
        There is no assurance that quality natural and organic products will be available to meet our future needs. If conventional supermarkets significantly increase
their natural and organic product offerings or if new laws require the reformulation of certain products to meet tougher standards, the supply of these products may be constrained. Any significant
disruption in the supply of quality natural and organic products could have a material impact on our overall sales and cost of goods sold. 
Perishable Foods Product Losses Could Materially Impact Our Results  
        We believe our stores more heavily emphasize perishable products than conventional supermarket stores. Perishable products accounted for approximately 67% of
total retail sales at Whole Foods Market locations in fiscal year 2007. The Company's emphasis on perishable products may result in significant product inventory losses in the event of extended power
outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences. 
Our Stock Price Is Volatile  
        The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events. These market factors and events
include variations in our sales and earnings results, changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, publicity regarding us, our competitors, the natural products industry generally, new
statutes or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the natural products industry specifically, sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the
public market or the perception that such sales could occur and other factors. In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been
unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
Changes in the Number of Stock Option Exercises Could Impact Our Cash Flow  
        Our cash flow from the exercise of team member stock options may be adversely affected in the future by fluctuations in the market price of our common stock,
changes in income tax law, and changes in the number of stock options we grant. 
Capital Needed for Expansion May Not Be Available  
        The construction and opening or acquisition of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities, along with the remodeling and
renovation of existing stores, require significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through proceeds from public offerings, bank debt, private placements of debt,
internally generated cash flow, and proceeds from stock option exercises. These and other sources of capital may not be available to us in the future. In addition, restrictive covenants that may be
imposed by our lenders may restrict our ability to fund our growth. 
27



 

We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights  
        We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property.
There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of certain
foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our proprietary
information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Self-Insurance Plan Claims Could Materially Impact Our Results  
        The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general
liability, property insurance, director and officers' liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Our results could be materially impacted by claims and other
expenses related to such plans if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 
Changes in Accounting Standards Could Materially Impact Our Results  
        Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many aspects of our business,
such as accounting for insurance and self-insurance, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, store closures, leases, income taxes and share-based compensation, are highly complex and
involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported earnings without a comparable underlying change in
cash flow from operations. 
Effective Tax Rate Changes and Results of Examinations by Taxing Authorities Could Materially Impact Our Results  
        Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by the earnings mix being lower than historical results in states or countries where we have lower
statutory rates and higher than historical results in states or countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in
tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other state and local taxing authorities. Our results
could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. 
The Company May Discontinue Paying Dividends in the Future  
        Dividends are paid at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which
the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. There is no guarantee that the Company will pay dividends
in the future. 
28



 

Failure of our Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Could Materially Impact our Business and Results  
        The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. An internal control system, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial
results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud, and could expose us to litigation or adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 
 
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.     
        Not applicable. 
 
 
Item 2. Properties.     
        As of September 30, 2007, we operated 276 stores: 263 stores in 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and six stores in the
United Kingdom. This includes 74 stores (net of divested locations) acquired from Wild Oats Markets, Inc. on August 28, 2007: 70 stores in 22 U.S. states and four stores in Canada. We
own seven stores, two distribution facilities and land for one store, including the adjacent property, and one distribution center in development. We also own a store and a building on leased land,
which is leased to third parties, and have eight stores in development on leased land. All other stores, distribution centers, bakehouses and administrative facilities are leased, with expiration
dates ranging from one to 35 years. We have options to renew most of our leases in five-year increments with renewal periods ranging from five to 50 years. The following
table shows the number of our stores by state, the District of Columbia, Canada and the United Kingdom as of September 30, 2007:

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.     
        From time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property and
other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business which have not resulted in any material losses to date. In addition, the FTC is currently pursing an administrative proceeding concerning
our recent acquisition of Wild Oats Markets and the Company has been contacted by the staff of the SEC regarding an inquiry related to online financial message board postings related to Whole Foods
Market and Wild Oats Markets. Although management does not expect that the outcome in any of these proceedings, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect our operating results or
cash flows in a particular period.

(1)Dividend accrued at September 30, 2007
        On
November 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share payable January 22, 2008 to
shareholders of record on January 11, 2008. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends,
and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications,
the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. 
        On
November 8, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200 million over four years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2006, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 2.0 million shares of Company common stock that were held in treasury at September 24, 2006 for a total of approximately
$100 million. On November 6, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase in the Company's stock repurchase program, bringing the total remaining
authorization to $200 million. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million additional shares of Company common stock on the open
market for a total of approximately $100 million. The average price per share paid for shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007 was $43.98, for a total of approximately
$200 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company retired all shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007. The Company's remaining authorization under the stock
repurchase program at September 30, 2007, is approximately $100 million through November 8, 2009. The specific timing and repurchase of future amounts will vary based on market
conditions, securities law limitations and other factors and will be made using the Company's available resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior
notice.

        On
November 9, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split, distributed on December 27, 2005 to shareholders of record
at the close of business on December 12, 2005. The stock split was affected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Shareholders received one additional share of Whole Foods Market common stock
for each share owned. All shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company's stock option and stock purchase plans were automatically increased by the same proportion. In addition, shares subject
to outstanding options or other rights to acquire the Company's stock and the exercise price for such shares were adjusted proportionately. All share and per share amounts in the accompanying
financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock split. This was the Company's third stock split since going public in January 1992. The Company previously affected
two-for-one stock splits in the form of a 100% stock dividend on November 29, 1993 and on June 4, 2001.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     
 
 
General     
        Whole Foods Market is the world's leading natural and organic foods supermarket and America's first national "Certified Organic" grocer. Our Company mission is to
promote the vitality and well-being of all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Since the purity of our food and the health of our bodies are
directly related to the purity and health of our environment, our core mission is devoted to the promotion of organically grown foods, food safety concerns, and the sustainability of our entire
ecosystem. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over
the last 27 years. 
        Whole
Foods Market, Inc. is a Texas corporation incorporated in 1980. The Company is based in Austin, Texas and conducts business through various wholly owned subsidiaries. We
operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. 
        We
opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and completed our initial public offering in January 1992. As of September 30, 2007, we operated 276 stores organized
into 11 geographic operating regions, each with its own leadership team: 263 stores in 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and six stores in the United Kingdom. This
includes 74 stores (net of divested locations) acquired from Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats") on August 28, 2007: 70 stores in 22 U.S. states and four stores in Canada. 
        Effective
August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats"), a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America, in
a cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million plus the assumption of approximately $148 million in existing debt. Wild Oats results of operations are included in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period beginning August 28, 2007 through September 30, 2007. At the date of acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores in 23 states and
British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats Marketplace nationwide, Henry's Farmers Market ("Henry's") in Southern California, Sun Harvest in Texas, and Capers Community Market
("Capers") in British Columbia. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to all 35 Henry's and
Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer. The Company received
proceeds totaling approximately $165 million for the net assets of those stores, consisting primarily of fixed assets, inventories and operating leases. This sale was completed effective
September 30, 2007. Of the remaining 74 Wild Oats and Capers banner stores the Company acquired in the Wild Oats Markets transaction, the Company has closed nine stores, including one that will
re-open after an extended renovation period, and relocated two stores to date, and currently intends to close an additional store, re-open the renovated location, and relocate
an additional seven stores to existing Whole Foods Market sites in development. 
        Our
results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first
year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52- or
53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal year 2007 was a 53-week year and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were 52-week years.

Fiscal Year 2007 Executive Summary     
        Effective August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats, a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America with 109
stores in 23 states and British Columbia at the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and
liabilities related to all 35 Henry's and Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based
food retailer. All of our 11 operating regions gained stores, with our three smallest regions, the Florida, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions, gaining critical mass. The acquisition
provided us with immediate entry into five new states: Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah, and 15 new markets: Bend, OR; Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Lexington, KY; Little Rock, AR;
Melbourne, FL; Memphis, TN; Naples, FL; Nashville, TN; Reno, NV; Salt Lake City, UT; Tampa, FL; Tucson, AZ; Tulsa, OK; and Westport, CT. 
        Fiscal
year 2007 was a 53-week year and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were 52-week years. Sales for fiscal year 2007 totaled approximately $6.6 billion, an
increase of approximately 17.6% over the prior year, driven by 14% ending square footage growth (excluding acquired Wild Oats locations) and comparable store sales growth of 7.1%. Adjusted to reflect
a fifty-two week period in fiscal year 2007, sales increased 15.3% over the prior fiscal year. 
        Net
income for fiscal year 2007 totaled approximately $182.7 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.29. 
        Our
capital expenditures for fiscal year 2007 totaled approximately $529.7 million, of which approximately $389.3 million was for new store development. We opened 21 new
stores during fiscal year 2007, and we ended the fiscal year with 276 stores. 
        At
the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company had total debt of approximately $760.9 million, including a $700 million term loan used to finance the Wild Oats acquisition,
approximately $21.8 million in Wild Oats and $2.7 million in Whole Foods Market convertible debentures, approximately $19.4 million in capital lease obligations and approximately
$17 million in borrowings on the Company's revolving line of credit. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company paid off the Wild Oats convertible debentures and the credit line
balance. 
        Subsequent
to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company received approximately $165.1 million in proceeds from the sale of the Henry's and Sun Harvest stores. 
        The
Company paid quarterly cash dividends totaling approximately $96.7 million during fiscal year 2007. On September 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved a
quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share that was paid on October 23, 2007 to shareholders of record on October 12, 2007. On November 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors
approved an 11% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share payable January 22, 2008 to shareholders of record on January 11, 2008. 
        During
fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares of Company common stock on the open market for a total of approximately $100 million. The
Company's remaining authorization under the stock repurchase program at September 30, 2007 is approximately $100 million through November 8, 2009.

Figures may not add due to rounding.  
 Sales  
        Sales totaled approximately $6.59 billion, $5.61 billion and $4.70 billion in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing
increases of 17.6%, 19.3% and 21.6% over the previous fiscal years, respectively. Adjusted to reflect a fifty-two week period in fiscal year 2007, sales increased 15.3% over the prior
fiscal year. Sales for fiscal year 2007 reflect five weeks of sales from Wild Oats stores. Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store
sales increases of approximately 7.1%, 11.0% and 12.8% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty-third full week after the
store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales increased approximately 5.8%, 10.3% and 11.5% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions
of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison. Stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from
the comparable and identical store base in the first fiscal week of closure until re-opened for a full fiscal week. Ending square footage growth from stores opened and acquired was
approximately 46%, 10% and 13% for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, average transactions per week increased approximately 4.3%, 5.6% and 6.9% over
the prior fiscal year, respectively, and average basket size increased approximately 2.6%, 5.0% and 5.5% over the prior fiscal year, respectively. The Company believes the integration of the acquired
Wild Oats stores into our operations and new store openings will drive strong sales growth and comparable store sales growth in future periods. For fiscal year 2008, on a 52-week to
52-week basis, the Company expects sales growth of 25% to 30%, of which approximately 10% is expected to come from the Wild Oats stores, and comparable store sales growth of 7.5% to 9.5% 
36



 

Gross Profit  
        Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation
operations. Gross profit totaled approximately $2.30 billion, $1.96 billion and $1.65 billion in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of
sales was 34.8%, 34.9% and 35.1% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of
weather or a host of other factors, including inflation. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower
shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. We have many buying initiatives in place that are benefiting our customers. Our
strategy is to be competitively priced on a market-by-market basis on commodity-type products and on identical product brands in grocery and Whole Body; however,
our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality, broader selection, and better customer service available in our produce, meat, seafood, bakery, specialty and prepared foods
departments. 
Direct Store Expenses  
        Direct store expenses totaled approximately $1.71 billion, $1.42 billion and $1.22 billion in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 26.0%, 25.4% and 26.0% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Direct store expenses in fiscal year 2005 include natural
disaster costs totaling approximately $13.4 million. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct
store expense as a percentage of sales tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. The Company does not expect
to leverage direct store expenses in fiscal year 2008 due primarily to anticipated investments in labor and benefits at the acquired stores and continued, though more moderate, increases in health
care costs as a percentage of sales. 
General and Administrative Expenses  
        General and administrative expenses totaled approximately $217.7 million, $181.2 million and $158.9 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.3%, 3.2% and 3.4% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. General and administrative expenses in
fiscal year 2007 include approximately $13 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in costs incurred during the fourth quarter related to legal matters, Wild Oats integration efforts and the
addition of Wild Oats' expenses. The Company currently expects general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales in fiscal year 2008 to be in line with the 3.3% reported in fiscal year
2007, due primarily to the temporary costs associated with integrating the Wild Oats acquisition along with the cost of fully staffing the Company's three smallest regions which gained the greatest
number of stores, as a percentage of our existing store base, in the merger.

Pre-opening and Relocation Costs  
        Pre-opening costs include rent expense incurred during construction of new stores and other costs related to new store openings, including costs
associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Rent expense is generally incurred approximately nine months prior to a store's opening date. Other
pre-opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation
costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. Pre-opening and relocation costs totaled approximately $70.2 million, $37.4 million and $37.0 million in
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Pre-opening and relocation costs as a percentage of sales were 1.1%, 0.7% and 0.8% in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Stores
newly opened and relocated were as follows:

Interest Expense  
        Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $4.2 million, $32,000 and $2.2 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The increase in net interest expense in fiscal year 2007 over the prior fiscal year includes interest expense on the $700 million term loan we entered into on August 28,
2007 to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The reduction in net interest expense in fiscal year 2006 from the prior fiscal year includes the decrease in interest expense on convertible
debentures due to the voluntary conversion by holders of approximately $150.1 million of the carrying amount of the debentures to approximately 6.0 million shares of Company common stock
during fiscal year 2005. The Company had approximately $17 million outstanding on its revolving line of credit at September 30, 2007 and no amounts outstanding at the end of fiscal years
2006 and 2005. Company made the final principal payment of approximately $5.7 million to retire its senior notes on May 16, 2006. The Company expects interest expense, net of investment
and other income, to range from approximately $35 million to $40 million in fiscal year 2008. 
Investment and Other Income  
        Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses, interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $11.3 million,
$20.7 million and $9.6 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in investment and other income in fiscal year 2007 from the prior fiscal year primarily
resulted from lower average investment balances. The increase in investment and other income in fiscal year 2006 over the prior fiscal year primarily resulted from higher yields on investments and
higher average investment balances. Investment and other income for fiscal year 2006 includes approximately $2.1 million of insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Katrina losses. 
Income Taxes  
        Our effective tax rate on income was approximately 40.0% in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and approximately 42.5% in fiscal year 2005. The increase in our effective
tax rate for fiscal year 2005 resulted primarily from the non-deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options during the fourth quarter. 
38



 

Share-Based Payments  
        The Company recognized share-based payments expense totaling approximately $19.9 million in fiscal year 2005. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in
order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company recognized an estimated share-based payments expense totaling approximately $17.4 million in fiscal year
2005 related to this acceleration. The Company also recognized share-based payments expense in fiscal year 2005 totaling approximately $2.5 million for modification of terms of certain stock
option grants and other compensation based on the intrinsic value of the Company's common stock. The Company's effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2005 was higher than its
historical rate primarily due to the non-deductible portion of the expense recognized for the accelerated vesting of stock options. 
        In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 123R,  "Share-Based Payment," which requires all companies to
recognize an expense for share-based payments, including stock options, based on the fair value
of the equity instrument. In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted a final rule amending Rule 4-01(a) of Regulation S-X
amending the compliance date for SFAS No. 123R to be effective starting with the first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after June 15, 2005.
The provisions of SFAS No. 123R were effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2006. 
        The
Company recognized share-based payments expense before income taxes under the requirements of SFAS No. 123R totaling approximately $13.2 million and $9.4 million
during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in the fiscal year 2007 and 2006 total expense is approximately $0.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for modification of
terms of certain stock option grants and approximately $4.4 million and $3.0 million, respectively, to increase the estimated charge related to the 2005 acceleration based on actual
experience. Share-based payments expense was included in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated (in thousands):

        The
Company expects share-based payments expense before income taxes of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million per quarter in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2008
and approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million per quarter in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year following the Company's annual grant date early in the third quarter, when
the majority of options are granted. 
39



 

Natural Disaster Costs  
        The Company has two stores in the New Orleans area which were damaged by and closed due to Hurricane Katrina during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and
accordingly the Company recorded expenses in fiscal year 2005 totaling approximately $16.5 million for related estimated net losses. The main components of the $16.5 million expense were
estimated impaired assets totaling approximately $12.2 million, estimated inventory losses totaling approximately $2.5 million, salaries and relocation allowances for displaced Team
Members and other costs totaling approximately $3.4 million, and a $1.0 million special donation from the Company to the American Red Cross, net of accrued estimated insurance proceeds
totaling approximately $2.6 million. In fiscal year 2005, approximately $13.4 million of net natural disaster costs is included in "Direct store expenses" in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations, approximately $1.0 million is included in "General and administrative expenses," and approximately $2.1 million is included in "Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs." In
fiscal year 2006, the Company recognized approximately $7.2 million in pre-tax credits for insurance proceeds and other adjustments related to previously estimated Hurricane Katrina
losses, of which approximately $4.2 million is included in "Direct store expenses," approximately $0.9 million is included in "Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs," and approximately
$2.1 million is included in "Investment and other income." 
 
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources     
        We generated cash flows from operating activities of approximately $398.6 million, $452.7 million and $410.8 million in fiscal years 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities resulted primarily from our net income less non-cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team
member stock options and changes in operating working capital. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of fiscal year 2006, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from
tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00-15, "Classification in the
Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option." SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings
resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow. The Company's excess tax benefit received upon exercise of nonqualified team member
stock options totaled approximately $12.8 million and $52.0 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately $895.0 million, $569.3 million and $322.2 million for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. For
fiscal year 2007, net cash used in investing activities includes approximately $596.2 million paid for the purchase of Wild Oats. Our principal historical capital requirements have been the
funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the
new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Capital expenditures for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled approximately
$529.7 million, $340.2 million and $324.1 million, respectively, of which approximately $389.3 million, $208.6 million and $207.8 million, respectively, was
for new store development and approximately $140.3 million, $131.6 million and $116.3 million, respectively, was for remodels and other additions. The increase in capital
expenditures on new stores in fiscal year 2007 was due to the Company's accelerated rate of new store opening in the year. The Company expects a comparable number of new store openings in fiscal year
2008 as in fiscal year 2007. For fiscal year 2008, the Company expects capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately $575 million to $625 million, of which approximately 65%
to 70% is related to new stores expected to open in fiscal year 2008 and beyond and approximately 7% to 8% relates to remodels of acquired stores.

        Average
pre-opening expense per store and average pre-opening rent per store during fiscal year 2007 in the table above exclude the Kensington store opened in
London during fiscal year 2007. The Company expects total pre-opening and relocation costs for fiscal year 2008 to range from approximately $80 million to $90 million.
Approximately $40 million to $45 million of this total relates to stores expected to open in fiscal year 2008. These ranges are based on estimated tender dates which are subject to
change. The Company expects average pre-opening and relocation expense for stores opening in fiscal year 2008 to be consistent with the average for stores that opened in fiscal year 2007,
excluding the Kensington store in London. On an average weekly basis, the Company expects quarterly pre-opening and relocation expense to ramp up throughout each quarter of the year. 
        Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately $494.1 million and $25.2 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2005, respectively. Net cash used by financing
activities was approximately $189.7 million in fiscal year 2006. Net proceeds to the Company from the exercise of stock options by team members are driven by a number of factors, including
fluctuations in our stock price, and totaled approximately $54.4 million, $222.0 million and $85.8 million in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The higher rate of
stock option exercises in fiscal year 2006 resulted in part from the accelerated vesting of stock options on September 22, 2005.

        On
August 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five-year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The loan, which is
secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock of our subsidiaries, bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the LIBOR plus an applicable margin, 1% as of
September 30, 2007, based on the Company's Moody's and S&P rating. At September 30, 2007, the applicable interest rate based on one-month LIBOR was 6.13%. The term loan
agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as
defined in the agreement. At September 30, 2007, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a
three-year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $490 million to fix the interest rate at 5.718%, inclusive of the applicable margin and associated fees, to help
manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
        On
August 28, 2007, we also replaced our previous revolving credit facility with a new $250 million revolving line of credit that extends to 2012. The credit agreement
contains an accordion feature under which the Company can increase the revolving credit facility to $350 million. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including
maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 30, 2007 and
September 24, 2006, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of the alternative base rate or
the LIBOR plus an applicable margin, 1% at September 30, 2007, based on the Company's Moody's and S&P rating. At September 30, 2007, the applicable interest rate based on the alternative
base rate was 7.75%. Commitment fees of 0.2% at September 30, 2007 of the undrawn amount, reduced by outstanding letters of credit, are payable under this agreement. At September 30,
2007, we had $17 million drawn under this agreement, which was paid off subsequent to year-end. No amounts were drawn under the previous agreement at September 24, 2006. The
amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $145.1 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $87.9 million and current borrowings
at September 30, 2007. 
        We
have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $24.5 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2007
and September 24, 2006, respectively. The Company assumed convertible debentures totaling approximately $115.0 million in the Wild Oats acquisition, of which approximately
$94.2 million was paid off during fiscal year 2007 and approximately $21.8 million, which included a related conversion premium totaling approximately $0.9 million, was paid off
subsequent to year-end. The remaining Whole Foods Market debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and a scheduled maturity date of March 2, 2018. The debentures are
convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on
March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this
purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price
plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original
discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. The debentures have a conversion rate of 21.28 shares of
Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, or approximately 97,000 shares and 311,000 shares at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. Approximately
$5.8 million and $5.0 million of the carrying amount of the debentures were voluntarily converted by holders to approximately 215,000 and 194,000 shares of Company common stock during
fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively.

        The
Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of certain equipment, buildings and land. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates
through 2028. Capital leases totaling approximately $19.1 million were assumed with the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. 
        The
Company expects interest expense, net of investment income, to range from approximately $35 million to $40 million in fiscal year 2008.

Although the timing of any potential redemption is uncertain, the above table reflects the assumption that the remaining Whole Foods Market convertible debentures, shown at accreted value as of
September 30, 2007, will be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008. 
        We
periodically make other commitments and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business.
Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

(1)Dividend accrued at September 30, 2007
        On
November 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share payable January 22, 2008 to
shareholders of record on January 11, 2008. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends,
and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications,
the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.

        On
November 8, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200 million over four years. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2006, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 2.0 million shares of Company common stock that were held in treasury at September 24, 2006 for a total of approximately
$100 million. On November 6, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase in the Company's stock repurchase program, bringing the total remaining
authorization to $200 million. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million additional shares of Company common stock on the open
market for a total of approximately $100 million. The average price per share paid for shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007 was $43.98, for a total of approximately
$200 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company retired all shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007. The Company's remaining authorization under the stock
repurchase program at September 30, 2007 is approximately $100 million through November 8, 2009. The specific timing and repurchase of future amounts will vary based on market
conditions, securities law limitations and other factors and will be made using the Company's available resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior
notice. 
        Our
principal historical sources of liquidity have been cash generated by operations, available unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and amounts
available under our revolving line of credit. There can be no assurance, however, that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that our revolving line of credit or other
sources of capital will be available to us in the future. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the
Company's needs and market conditions. Absent any significant cash acquisition or significant change in market condition, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for the next twelve months will be funded by these sources. 
 
 
Critical Accounting Policies     
        The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our
accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances. 
        We
have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in
a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most
critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. 
Insurance and Self-Insurance Liabilities  
        The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general
liability, property insurance, director and officers' liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the
estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 
44



 

Reserves for Closed Properties  
        The Company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores, distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current
operations. The Company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments after the closing
date, net of estimated subtenant income. The closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms, which generally range from one to 17 years. The Company estimates
subtenant income and future cash flows based on the Company's experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, the Company's previous efforts to dispose of similar
assets and existing economic conditions. 
        Capital
lease properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value. Reduction in the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when
expected net future cash flows are less than the assets' carrying value. The Company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is
located and, when necessary, utilizes local real estate brokers. 
        Adjustments
to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in
estimates in the period in which the changes become known. 
Inventory Valuation  
        We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for
approximately 81.7% and 93.9% of inventories in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items
purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO
reserve, was approximately $20.0 million and $13.2 million at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. Costs for remaining inventories are determined by the
first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Cost was determined using the retail method and the item cost method for inventories in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Under the retail
method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by counting each item in inventory, then applying a cost-to-retail ratio for various
groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates which could impact the ending
inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. The item cost method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase
costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting enables management to more precisely manage inventory and
purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting. 
Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
        Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, on a reporting unit level. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our annual impairment
review requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different
organizational level, could produce significantly different results. 
45



 

Income Taxes  
        We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis
and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant accounting
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and
calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. Although we believe
that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. 
Share-Based Payments  
        The Company maintains several share-based incentive plans. We historically granted options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended.
At our annual shareholder's meeting, on March 5, 2007, our shareholders approved a new plan, the Whole Foods Market 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. Options are granted pursuant to this new plan.
Under both plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the grant date and are generally exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning
one year from grant date and have a five-year term. The grant date is established once the Company's Board of Directors approves the grant and all key terms have been determined. The
exercise prices of our stock option grants are the closing price on the grant date. Stock option grant terms and conditions are communicated to team members within a relatively short period of time.
Our Company generally approves one primary stock option grant annually, occurring during a trading window. 
        Our
Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full-time team members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Participating team members may purchase our
common stock through payroll deductions. At our annual meeting, shareholders approved a new Team Member Stock Purchase Plan ("TMSPP") which became effective on April 1, 2007. The TMSPP replaces
all previous stock purchase plans and provides for a 5% discount on the shares purchase date market value which meets the "Safe Harbor" provisions of SFAS No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" and
therefore is non-compensatory. Under the previous plans, participating team members could elect to purchase unrestricted shares at 100% of market value or restricted shares at 85% of
market value on the purchase date. 
        Prior
to the effective date of revised SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" and related interpretations for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of
the stock option at date of grant. 
46



 

        Effective
the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this
method, prior periods were not restated. The Company uses the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including
estimates of the expected term team members will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock price over the expected term, and the
number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. The related share-based payments expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based payments and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding, but not yet vested, on the effective date. 
        SFAS
No. 123R requires the Company to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS No. 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts in
the income statement over the stock option's remaining vesting period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options
held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company
intends to keep its broad-based stock option program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from share-based
payments expense will not exceed 10%. 
        Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow,
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00-15, "Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise
of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option." SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements
as a financing cash flow. 
        In
November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of the Share-Based Payment
Awards" ("FSP FAS 123R-3"). The Company has elected to adopt the transition guidance for the additional paid-in-capital pool ("APIC pool") in
paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R. The prescribed transition method is a detailed method to establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of share-based
compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects of share-based payment awards that are outstanding upon adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. 
47



 

 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements     
        In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," an interpretation of SFAS
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109. The interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with Statement 109 and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on management's best
judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Early adoption is permitted as
of the beginning of an enterprise's fiscal year, provided the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for any interim period, for that fiscal year. FIN 48
becomes effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48, the Company does not expect the cumulative impact of
the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
        In
September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 ("SAB No. 108"), "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
the Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in
current-year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either
approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective for fiscal years ending after
November 15, 2006. SAB 108 was effective for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 and had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards, except for
measurements of share-based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value and does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at
fair value. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the specified fair value measures for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS
No. 157 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending September 27, 2009, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS
No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
        In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 applies to all entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The provisions of SFAS No. 159
are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending September 27, 2009. We are currently evaluating
the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
48




  


        In May 2007, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
No. 48." The FSP amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax
benefits. FSP No. FIN 48-1 should be applied upon the initial adoption of FIN 48, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FSP No. FIN 48-1
becomes effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP No. FIN 48-1, the adoption will not have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
 
 
Disclaimer on Forward-Looking Statements     
        Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in
government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors." The Company does not undertake any obligation to update
forward-looking statements. 
 
 
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.     
        We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long-term debt. We do not use financial instruments for
trading or other speculative purposes. We are also exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiaries. 
Interest Rate Risk  
        We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long-term debt. Our
line of credit borrowings do not give rise to significant fair value risk because these borrowings have revolving maturities. At September 30, 2007, approximately $17 million was
outstanding under our line of credit agreement. At September 24, 2006, the Company held interest-bearing instruments that were classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments. These investments were of a short-term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have had a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or
interest income. We classified these investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, recorded them at fair value on our balance sheet. At September 24, 2006, these
investments totaled approximately $203.9 million and earned an average interest rate of approximately 3.8%. At September 24, 2006, an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million
related to these investments was included as a component of shareholders' equity. 
        During
fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five-year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The loan bears
interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin, 1% as of September 30, 2007, based on the Company's Moody's and S&P rating. Our term loans do
not give rise to significant fair value risk because they are variable interest rate loans with revolving maturities which reflect market changes to interest rates. Subsequent to the end of fiscal
year 2007, the Company entered into a three-year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $490 million to fix the interest rate at 5.718%, inclusive of the applicable
margin and associated fees, to help manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
49



 

Interest Rate and Market Risk  
        Our zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market
price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. During fiscal year 2007 and 2006 approximately $5.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, of the carrying amount, of the
debentures were converted, at the option of the holder, into Company common stock. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding
balance of approximately $2.7 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. At September 30, 2007 the interest rate and market
risk associated with the convertible debentures is not material. At September 24, 2006 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately
$11.0 million. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would decrease or increase
accordingly. 
Market Risk  
        We regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair
value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. 
Foreign Currency Risk  
        The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk. We own and operate seven natural and organic foods supermarkets in Canada and six natural and organic
foods supermarkets in the United Kingdom. Sales made from the Canadian and United Kingdom stores are made in exchange for Canadian dollars and Great Britain pounds, respectively. We do not hedge
against this risk because of the small amounts of funds at risk.

Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
To
the Board of Directors
Whole Foods Market, Inc. 
        We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (the "Company") as of September 24, 2006 and September 30, 2007, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2007. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whole Foods Market, Inc. at
September 24, 2006 and September 30, 2007, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended
September 30, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s internal
control over financial
reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated November 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     
To
the Board of Directors
Whole Foods Market, Inc. 
        We
have audited Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        As
indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Wild Oats Markets, Inc., which is included in the 2007 consolidated financial statements of Whole Foods Market, Inc. and
constituted 9% and 2% of total and net assets, respectively, as of September 30, 2007 and 2% and 2% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting of Whole Foods Market, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. 
        In
our opinion, Whole Foods Market, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007, based on the
COSO criteria. 
        We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Whole Foods
Market, Inc. as of September 24, 2006 and September 30, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows
for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 30, 2007 of Whole Foods Market, Inc. and our report dated November 27, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005    
(1)   Description of Business  
        Whole Foods Market, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively "Whole Foods Market," "Company," or "We") own and operate the largest chain of
natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well-being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available.
Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last
27 years. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 30, 2007 we have expanded our operations both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third
parties to 276 stores: 263 stores in 37 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; seven stores in Canada; and six stores in the United Kingdom. 
        Effective
August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild Oats"), a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America, in
a cash tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million plus the assumption of approximately $148 million in existing debt. Wild Oats results of operations are included in
our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period beginning August 28, 2007 through September 30, 2007. At the date of acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores in 23 states and
British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats Marketplace nationwide, Henry's Farmers Market ("Henry's") in Southern California, Sun Harvest in Texas, and Capers Community Market
("Capers") in British Columbia. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities related to all 35 Henry's and
Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart & Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer. Subsequent to
year-end, the Company received proceeds totaling approximately $165 million for the net assets of those stores, consisting primarily of fixed assets, inventories and operating
leases. This sale was completed effective September 30, 2007. Of the remaining 74 Wild Oats and Capers banner stores the Company acquired in the Wild Oats Markets transaction, the Company has
closed nine stores, including one that will re-open after an extended renovation period, and relocated two stores to date, and currently intends to close an additional store,
re-open the renovated location, and relocate an additional seven stores to existing Whole Foods Market sites in development. 
(2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Definition of Fiscal Year  
        We report our results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal year 2007 was a
53-week year and fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were 52-week years. 
Principles of Consolidation  
        The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All significant
majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, and all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. 
58



 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  
        We consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. 
Investments  
        We classify as available-for-sale our cash equivalent investments and our short-term and long-term investments in
debt and equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of
the related tax effect, on available-for-sale investments are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. A decline
in the fair value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary or for a period greater than two fiscal
quarters results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis of the security is established. Cost basis is established and maintained
utilizing the specific identification method. 
Restricted Cash  
        Restricted cash primarily relates to cash held as collateral to support a portion of our projected workers' compensation obligations. 
Inventories  
        We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method for
approximately 81.7% and 93.9% of inventories in fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items
purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO
reserve, was approximately $20.0 million and $13.2 million at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. Costs for remaining inventories are determined by the
first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. 
        Cost
was determined using the retail method and the item cost method for inventories in fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the
resulting gross margins are determined by counting each item in inventory, then applying a cost-to-retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of
inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting
gross margins. The item cost method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and
recording the actual cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method
of accounting. 
        Our
largest supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc., accounted for approximately 24%, 22% and 22% of our total purchases in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
59



 

Property and Equipment  
        Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We provide depreciation of equipment over the estimated useful lives
(generally three to 15 years) using the straight-line method. We provide amortization of leasehold improvements and real estate assets under capital lease on the
straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the related leases. Terms of leases used in the determination of estimated useful
lives may include renewal periods at the Company's option if exercise of the option is determined to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease. We provide depreciation of buildings over the
estimated useful lives (generally 20 to 30 years) using the straight-line method. Costs related to a projected site determined to be unsatisfactory and general site selection costs
that cannot be identified with a specific store location are charged to operations currently. The Company recognizes a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when
the obligation is incurred. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on significant projects constructed or developed for the Company's own use are capitalized as a
separate component of the asset. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any gain or loss is reflected in earnings. 
Operating Leases  
        The Company leases stores, distribution centers, bakehouses and administrative facilities under operating leases. Store lease agreements generally include rent
holidays, rent escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions for percentage of sales in excess of specified levels. Most of our lease agreements include renewal periods at the Company's option. We
recognize rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term beginning with the date the Company takes possession of the leased space for
construction and other purposes. We record tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays as deferred rent liabilities and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the lease to rent. We record
rent liabilities for contingent percentage of sales lease provisions when we determine that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year. 
Goodwill  
        Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, on a reporting unit level. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing.
We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our annual impairment
review requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different
organizational level, could produce significantly different results. 
Intangible Assets  
        Intangible assets include acquired leasehold rights, trade names, brand names, liquor licenses, license agreements, non-competition agreements and
debt issuance costs. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets on a
straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, currently one to 48 years for contract-based intangible assets and one to five years for marketing-related and other
identifiable intangible assets.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of  
        We evaluate long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the
assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. When the Company commits to relocate a location, a charge to write down the related
assets to their estimated net recoverable value is included in the "Pre-opening and relocation costs" line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
        The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued payroll, bonuses and team member benefits,
and other accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Store closure reserves and estimated worker's compensation claims are recorded at net present
value to approximate fair value. Investments are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of shareholders' equity until realized. 
        The
carrying amounts of our five-year term loan and outstanding amounts on our revolving line of credit approximate fair value because they have variable interest rates which
reflect market changes to interest rates. The fair value of convertible subordinated debentures is estimated using quoted market prices. At September 30, 2007, the difference between the
carrying value and the estimated fair value of our convertible debentures is not material. At September 24, 2006, the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying
amount by approximately $11.0 million. 
Insurance and Self-Insurance Reserves  
        The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general
liability, property insurance, director and officers' liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the
estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 
Reserves for Closed Properties  
        The Company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations. The Company
provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancelable lease payments after the closing date, net of estimated
subtenant income. The closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms, which generally range from one to 17 years. The Company estimates subtenant income and
future cash flows based on the Company's experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located, the Company's previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing
economic conditions. 
61



 

        The
reserves for closed properties include management's estimates for lease subsidies, lease terminations and future payments on exited real estate. At September 30, 2007 and
September 24, 2006 these reserves totaled approximately $97.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Additions during fiscal year 2007 include approximately $92.7 of closure
reserves for Wild Oats Markets locations which were recorded in connection with the acquisition. 
        Capital
lease properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value. Reduction in the carrying values of property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when
expected net future cash flows are less than the assets' carrying value. The Company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is
located and, when necessary, utilizes local real estate brokers. 
        Adjustments
to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates. Adjustments are made for changes in
estimates in the period in which the changes become known. 
Revenue Recognition  
        We recognize revenue for sales of our products at the point of sale. Discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales
as the products are sold. 
Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Costs  
        Cost of goods sold includes cost of inventory sold during the period, net of discounts and allowances, contribution from non-retail distribution and
food preparation operations, shipping and handling costs and occupancy costs. The Company receives various rebates from third party vendors in the form of quantity discounts and payments under
cooperative advertising agreements. Quantity discounts and cooperative advertising discounts in excess of identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the
related merchandise is sold. 
Advertising  
        Advertising and marketing expense for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $33.0 million, $24.0 million and $20.1 million,
respectively. These amounts are shown net of vendor allowances received for cooperative advertising of approximately $1.2 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2005. Advertising costs are charged to
expense as incurred and are included in the "Direct store expenses" line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Pre-opening and Relocation Costs  
        Pre-opening costs include rent expense incurred during construction of new stores and costs related to new store openings including costs associated
with hiring and training personnel, smallwares, supplies and other miscellaneous costs. Rent expense is generally incurred approximately nine months prior to a store's opening date. Other
pre-opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store opening. Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred. Relocation costs, which consist of
moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment costs, other costs associated with replaced facilities and other related expenses, are expensed as incurred.

Share-Based Payments  
        The Company maintains several share-based incentive plans. We historically granted options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended.
At our annual shareholder's meeting, on March 5, 2007, our shareholders approved a new plan, the Whole Foods Market 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. Under both plans, options are granted at an option
price equal to the market value of the stock at the grant date and are generally exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from grant date and have a
five-year term. The grant date is established once the Company's Board of Directors approves the grant and all key terms have been determined. The exercise prices of our stock option
grants are the closing price on the grant date. Stock option grant terms and conditions are communicated to team members within a relatively short period of time. Our Company generally approves one
primary stock option grant annually, occurring during a trading window. 
        Our
Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full-time team members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Participating team members may purchase our
common stock through payroll deductions. At our 2006 annual meeting, shareholders approved a new Team Member Stock Purchase Plan ("TMSPP") which became effective on April 1, 2007. The TMSPP
replaces all previous stock purchase plans and provides for a 5% discount on the shares purchase date market value which meets the "Safe Harbor" provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards ("SFAS") No. 123R, "Share-Based Payment" and therefore is non-compensatory. Under the previous plans, participating team members could elect to purchase unrestricted
shares at 100% of market value or restricted shares at 85% of market value on the purchase date. 
        Prior
to the effective date of revised SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees" and related interpretations for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the
intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant. 
        Effective
the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective transition method. Under this
method, prior periods were not restated. The Company uses the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including
estimates of the expected term team members will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock price over the expected term, and the
number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. The related share-based payments expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based payments and consequently, the related amounts recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding, but not yet vested, on the effective date. 
        SFAS
No. 123R requires the Company to value unvested stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS No. 123 under the fair value method and expense these amounts in
the income statement over the stock option's remaining vesting period. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options
held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company
intends to keep its broad-based stock option program in place, but also intends to limit the number of shares granted in any one year so that annual earnings per share dilution from share-based
payments expense will not exceed 10%. 
63



 

        Prior
to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company presented the tax savings resulting from tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as an operating cash flow,
in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 00-15, "Classification in the Statement of Cash Flows of the Income Tax Benefit Received by a Company upon Exercise
of a Nonqualified Employee Stock Option." SFAS No. 123R requires the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements
as a financing cash flow. 
        In
November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of the Share-Based Payment
Awards" ("FSP FAS 123R-3"). The Company has elected to adopt the transition guidance for the additional paid-in-capital pool ("APIC pool") in
paragraph 81 of SFAS No. 123R. The prescribed transition method is a detailed method to establish the beginning balance of the APIC pool related to the tax effects of share-based
compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects of share-based payment awards that are outstanding upon adoption of
SFAS No. 123R. 
Income Taxes  
        We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis
and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Significant accounting
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company believes that its tax positions are consistent with applicable
tax, but certain positions may be challenged by taxing authorities. In evaluating liabilities associated with its various tax filing positions, the Company has accrued for probable liabilities in
accordance with the requirements of SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies." The Company records these tax contingencies to address the potential exposures that can result from the diverse
interpretations of tax statutes, rules and regulations. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. In addition, we are
subject to periodic audits and examinations by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these
estimates. 
Earnings per Share  
        Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus, where applicable, the additional common shares that would have been outstanding as a result of the conversion of dilutive options and
convertible debt. 
Comprehensive Income  
        Comprehensive income consists of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of income
taxes. Comprehensive income is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity and Comprehensive Income. At September 30, 2007, accumulated other comprehensive income consisted
of foreign currency translation adjustment gains of approximately $15.7 million. At September 24, 2006, accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of foreign currency translation
adjustment gains of approximately $6.9 million and unrealized gains on marketable securities of approximately $0.1 million. 
64



 

Foreign Currency Translation  
        The Company's Canadian and United Kingdom operations use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange
rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a
separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Segment Information  
        We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We currently have seven stores in Canada and six stores in the United Kingdom. All
of our remaining operations are domestic. 
Use of Estimates  
        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported.
Actual amounts could differ from those estimates. 
Reclassifications  
        Where appropriate, we have reclassified prior years' financial statements to conform to current year presentation. 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
        In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," an interpretation of SFAS
No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements in accordance with SFAS
No. 109. The interpretation applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with Statement 109 and requires a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on management's best
judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Early adoption is permitted as
of the beginning of an enterprise's fiscal year, provided the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements, including financial statements for any interim period, for that fiscal year. FIN 48
becomes effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48, the Company does not expect the cumulative impact of
the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
        In
September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.108 ("SAB No. 108"), "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in
the Current Year Financial Statements." SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior-year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in
current-year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either
approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The requirements of SAB No. 108 are effective for fiscal years ending after
November 15, 2006. SAB 108 was effective for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2007 and had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
65



 

        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards, except for
measurements of share-based payments and measurements that are similar to, but not intended to be, fair value and does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at
fair value. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are effective for the specified fair value measures for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS
No. 157 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending September 27, 2009, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS
No. 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
        In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities." SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to
measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS No. 159 applies to all entities that elect the fair value option. However, the amendment to SFAS No. 115
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" applies to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The provisions of SFAS No. 159
are effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending September 27, 2009. We are currently evaluating
the impact, if any, that the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
        In
May 2007, the FASB issued Staff Position ("FSP") No. FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation
No. 48". The FSP amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax
benefits. FSP No. FIN 48-1 should be applied upon the initial adoption of FIN 48, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FSP No. FIN 48-1
becomes effective for the Company's first quarter of fiscal year 2008. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of FSP No. FIN 48-1, the adoption will not have a
material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
(3)   Business Combination  
        Effective August 28, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats, a leading natural and organic foods retailer in North America, in a cash
tender offer of $18.50 per share, or approximately $565 million plus the assumption of approximately $148 million in existing debt. At the date of acquisition, Wild Oats had 109 stores
in 23 states and British Columbia, Canada operating under four banners: Wild Oats (nationwide), Henry's (in Southern California), Sun Harvest (in Texas) and Capers (in British Columbia). To fund the
transaction, we entered into a five-year $700 million senior term loan agreement. We also signed a new five-year $250 million revolving credit agreement, which
replaced our existing $200 million revolver. Wild Oats results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning August 28, 2007 through
September 30, 2007. In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of fixed
assets, inventories and operating leases, related to all 35 Henry's and Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart &
Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer for approximately $165 million. This sale was completed effective September 30, 2007. Regarding the other 74 Wild Oats and Capers
banner stores the Company acquired in the Wild Oats Markets transaction, the Company has closed nine stores, including one that will re-open after an extended renovation period, and
relocated two stores to date, and currently intends to close an additional store, re-open the renovated location, and relocate an additional seven stores to existing Whole Foods Market
sites in development. 
66



 

        Whole
Foods Market and Wild Oats have similar missions and core values, and the Company believes the synergies gained from this business combination will create long term value for our
customers, vendors and shareholders as well as exciting opportunities for our new and existing team members by making us better positioned to compete in this rapidly changing food retailing
environment. All of our 11 operating regions gained stores in the acquisition, with three of our smallest regions, the Florida, Rocky Mountain, and Pacific Northwest regions, gaining critical mass.
The acquisition provided us with immediate entry into five new states: Arkansas, Indiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Utah, and 15 new markets: Bend, OR; Cincinnati, OH; Indianapolis, IN; Lexington, KY;
Little Rock, AR; Melbourne, FL; Memphis, TN; Naples, FL; Nashville, TN; Reno, NV; Salt Lake City, UT; Tampa, FL; Tucson, AZ; Tulsa, OK; and Westport, CT. 
        The

Direct Costs of the Acquisition  
        Direct costs of the acquisition include investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees and other external costs directly related to the acquisition. 
Preliminary Purchase Price Allocation  
        The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting with Whole Foods Market treated as the acquiring entity in accordance with SFAS
No. 141, "Business Combinations." Accordingly, the consideration paid by Whole Foods Market to complete the acquisition has been allocated preliminarily to the assets and liabilities acquired
based upon their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The allocation of purchase price is based upon certain external valuations and other analyses that have not been completed as
of the date of this filing due to the timing of the closing of the acquisition late in the Company's fiscal year. Accordingly, the purchase price allocations are preliminary and are subject to future
adjustments during the allocation period as defined in SFAS No. 141. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recognized liabilities totaling approximately $8.4 million for
estimated costs associated with plans to involuntarily terminate certain team members of Wild Oats and liabilities totaling approximately $100.7 million for estimated costs associated with
plans to exit certain activities of Wild Oats, including estimated costs of closure of business activities in certain locations, that were included in the allocation of the acquisition cost. The
excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is non-amortizing for financial statement purposes
and is not tax deductible.

        The
Company assumed debt totaling approximately $148 million in the acquisition consisting primarily of convertible subordinated debentures and capital lease obligations. The
estimated fair value of the debt assumed by the Company was approximately $134 million. 
        The
estimated values of operating leases with unfavorable terms compared with current market conditions totaled approximately $1.5 million. These leases have an estimated weighted
average life of approximately 14 years and are included in other liabilities.

Henry's and Sun Harvest Divestiture  
        In connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats, the Company separately entered into an agreement to sell certain assets and liabilities, consisting primarily of
fixed assets, inventories and operating leases, related to all 35 Henry's and Sun Harvest stores and a related distribution center in Riverside, CA to a wholly owned subsidiary of Smart &
Final, Inc., a Los Angeles-based food retailer for approximately $165 million. This sale was completed effective September 30, 2007. The proceeds receivable are included on the
accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets under the caption "Proceeds receivable for divestiture." The Company received proceeds totaling approximately $165 million on October 1, 2007. As
part of purchase accounting for the Wild Oats acquisition, the Henry's and Sun Harvest net assets were adjusted to fair value and therefore no gain or loss was recognized related to this divestiture.
The results of operations for the divested locations are not material and are therefore included in operating income on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
        Summary

Transition Services Agreement  
        In connection with the sale of the Henry's and Sun Harvest stores, Whole Foods Market entered into a transition services agreement with Smart & Final under
which Whole Foods Market will continue to provide certain general and administrative services for the 35 stores for up to two years. The transition services agreement provides for payments to the
Company calculated for each service area as a certain percentage of total monthly sales of the Henry's and Sun Harvest locations, initially totaling 1.75% of total monthly sales for all services
provided under the agreement. The Company currently anticipates that the revenue associated with the agreement will be approximately equal to its incremental cost of providing the support. 
Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information  
        The following pro forma financial information presents the combined historical results of the operations of Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats as if the Wild Oats
acquisition and the sale of the Henry's and Sun Harvest stores had occurred at the beginning of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Certain adjustments have been made to reflect changes in
depreciation, amortization and income taxes based on the Company's preliminary estimates of fair values recognized in the application of purchase accounting, and interest expense on borrowings to
finance the acquisition. These adjustments are subject to change as the initial estimates are refined over time. 
69



 

        Due
to differences in accounting calendars, the pro forma results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 combines the fifty-three weeks ended
September 30, 2007 for Whole Foods Market with the fifty-two weeks ended September 30, 2007 for Wild Oats. The Wild Oats pro forma results of operations include approximately
47 weeks of Wild Oats results and approximately five weeks of actual results beginning August 25, 2007 which are included in Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The pro forma
results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2006 combines the fifty-two weeks of Whole Foods Market's fiscal year ended September 24, 2006 with the
fifty-two weeks of Wild Oats' fiscal year ended December 30, 2006. Pro forma results of operations are as follows (in thousands):

(4)   Natural Disaster Costs  
        The Company has two stores in the New Orleans area which were damaged by and closed due to Hurricane Katrina during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2005, and
accordingly the Company recorded expenses totaling approximately $16.5 million for related estimated net losses. The main components of the $16.5 million expense were estimated impaired
assets totaling approximately $12.2 million, estimated inventory losses totaling approximately $2.5 million, salaries and relocation allowances for displaced Team Members and other costs
totaling approximately $3.4 million, and a $1.0 million special donation from the Company to the American Red Cross, net of accrued estimated insurance proceeds totaling approximately
$2.6 million. In fiscal year 2005, approximately $13.4 million of net natural disaster costs is included in "Direct store expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations,
approximately $1.0 million is included in "General and administrative expenses," and approximately $2.1 million is included in "Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs." In fiscal year
2006, the Company recognized approximately $7.2 million in pre-tax credits for insurance proceeds and other adjustments related to previously estimated Hurricane Katrina losses, of
which approximately $4.2 million is included in "Direct store expenses," approximately $0.9 million is included in "Cost of goods sold and occupancy costs," and approximately
$2.1 million is included in "Investment and other income." 
(5)   Investments

As of November 20, 2007, we had signed leases for 87 stores under development. 
(7)   Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
        Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate goodwill to
one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. During fiscal year 2007, we acquired goodwill totaling approximately $555.4 million in connection with the acquisition of Wild Oats. During
fiscal year 2006, we acquired goodwill totaling approximately $1.1 million, primarily related to the acquisition of one small store in Portland, Maine. We acquired indefinite-lived intangible
assets totaling approximately $1.2 million and $50,000 during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, consisting primarily of liquor licenses. There was no impairment of goodwill or
indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal years 2007, 2006, or 2005. 
        Definite-lived
intangible assets are amortized over the useful life of the related agreement. We acquired definite-lived intangible assets totaling approximately $64.8 million and
$15.7 million during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively, consisting primarily of acquired leasehold rights. Of the definite-lived intangible assets acquired in fiscal year 2007,
approximately $42.8 million were associated with the acquisition of Wild Oats. This transaction is discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, "Business
Combinations." Amortization associated with intangible assets totaled approximately $2.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.8 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,

        On
August 28, 2007, the Company entered into a $700 million, five-year term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. The loan, which is
secured by a pledge of substantially all of the stock of our subsidiaries, bears interest at our option of the alternative base rate or the LIBOR plus an applicable margin, 1% as of
September 30, 2007, based on the Company's Moody's and S&P rating. At September 30, 2007, the applicable interest rate based on one-month LIBOR was 6.13%. The term loan
agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as
defined in the agreement. At September 30, 2007, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. Associated with the term loan, the Company also recorded approximately
$3.4 million related to debt origination fees, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the loan. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company
entered into a three-year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $490 million to fix the interest rate at 5.718%, inclusive of the applicable margin and associated
fees, to help manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
72



 

        On
August 28, 2007, we also replaced our previous revolving credit facility with a new $250 million revolving line of credit that extends to 2012. The credit agreement
contains an accordion feature under which the Company can increase the revolving credit facility to $350 million. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including
maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and payments as defined in the agreement. At September 30, 2007 and
September 24, 2006, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of the alternative base rate or
the LIBOR plus an applicable margin, 1% at September 30, 2007, based on the Company's Moody's and S&P rating. At September 30, 2007, the applicable interest rate based on the alternative
base rate was 7.75%. Commitment fees of 0.2% at September 30, 2007 of the undrawn amount, reduced by outstanding letters of credit, are payable under this agreement. At September 30,
2007, we had $17 million drawn under this agreement, which was paid off subsequent to year-end. No amounts were drawn under the previous agreement at September 24, 2006. The
amount available to the Company under the agreement was effectively reduced to $145.1 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $87.9 million and current borrowings
at September 30, 2007. 
        We
have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $24.5 million and $8.3 million at September 30, 2007
and September 24, 2006, respectively. The Company assumed convertible debentures totaling approximately $115.0 million in the Wild Oats acquisition, of which approximately
$94.2 million was paid off during fiscal year 2007 and approximately $21.8 million, which included a related conversion premium totaling approximately $0.9 million, was paid off
subsequent to year-end. The remaining Whole Foods Market debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and a scheduled maturity date of March 2, 2018. The debentures are
convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on
March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this
purchase price in cash, shares of common
stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date
of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The
debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness. The debentures have a conversion rate of 21.280 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal
amount at maturity, or approximately 97,000 shares and 311,000 shares at September 30, 2007 and September 24, 2006, respectively. Approximately $5.8 million and
$5.0 million of the carrying amount of the debentures were voluntarily converted by holders to shares of Company common stock during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        The
Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of certain equipment, buildings and land. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates
through 2028. Capital leases totaling approximately $19.1 million were assumed with the acquisition of Wild Oats Markets. Lease agreements are discussed further in Note 9 to the
consolidated financial statements, "Leases." 
(9)   Leases  
        The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment, buildings, and land and certain operating leases for rental of facilities and
equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates from 2007 to 2043. Amortization of equipment under capital lease is included with depreciation expense. 
73



 

        Rental
expense charged to operations under operating leases for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 totaled approximately $201.0 million, $153.1 million and
$124.8 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments required by all noncancelable leases are approximately as follows (in thousands):

        During
fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, we paid contingent rentals totaling approximately $9.9 million, $9.6 million and $7.6 million, respectively. At
September 30, 2007, we recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with operating leases totaling approximately $825,000. No asset retirement obligations associated with operating leases
were incurred during fiscal years 2006 and 2005. Sublease rental income totaled approximately $3.9 million, $1.6 million and $1.3 million during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. John Mackey and Glenda Chamberlain, executive officers of the Company, own approximately 51% and 2%, respectively, of BookPeople, Inc., a retailer of books and periodicals that is
unaffiliated with the Company, which leases retail space in Austin, Texas from the Company. The lease provides for an aggregate annual minimum rent of approximately $0.4 million which the
Company received in rental income in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005.

        Approximately
$68.0 million of the increase in the net deferred tax asset during fiscal year 2007 related to the recognition of deferred differences related to the acquisition of
Wild Oats Markets as a purchase price adjustment. 
        As
of September 30, 2007, we had international operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $24.7 million, of which approximately $6.1 million will begin to
expire in fiscal year 2014 and approximately $18.6 million has an indefinite life. During fiscal year 2007, approximately $4.3 million of the valuation allowance related to international
operating loss carryforwards was released due to improved earnings and the likelihood of using such assets in future periods. In addition, approximately $626,000 of the valuation allowance related to
the utilization of certain operating loss carryforwards was released. The valuation allowance also increased by approximately $1.1 million related to the establishment of a valuation allowance
on certain acquired state operating loss carryforwards. We have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $9.5 million for deferred tax assets associated with international operating loss
carryforwards, state operating loss carryforwards, and capital loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Management believes that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the remaining domestic deferred tax assets in the form of future tax deductions based on the nature of these deductible
temporary differences and a history of profitable operations. 
        At
September 30, 2007, a provision was not made for any United States or additional foreign taxes on undistributed earnings related to certain foreign operations as those earnings
are considered permanently reinvested. It is the Company's intention to utilize those earnings in the foreign operations for an indefinite period of time, or to repatriate such earnings only when
tax-efficient to do so.

(1)Dividend accrued at September 30, 2007

        On
November 20, 2007, the Company's Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share payable January 22, 2008 to
shareholders of record on January 11, 2008. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends,
and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications,
the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis. 
Treasury Stock  
        On November 8, 2005, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program of up to $200 million over four years. During the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2006, the Company repurchased on the open market approximately 2.0 million shares of Company common stock that were held in treasury at September 24, 2006 for a
total of approximately $100 million. On November 6, 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $100 million increase in the Company's stock repurchase program, bringing the
total remaining authorization to $200 million. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million additional shares of Company common stock
on the open market for a total of approximately $100 million. The average price per share paid for shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007 was $43.98, for a total of approximately
$200 million. Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2007, the Company retired all shares held in treasury at September 30, 2007. The Company's remaining authorization under the stock
repurchase program at September 30, 2007, is approximately $100 million through November 8, 2009. The specific timing and repurchase of future amounts will vary based on market
conditions, securities law limitations and other factors and will be made using the Company's available resources. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior
notice.

(12) Earnings per Share  
        The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted
earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents consisting of common shares deemed outstanding from the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed conversion of zero
coupon convertible subordinated debentures.

Stock Option Plan  
        We historically granted options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended. At our annual shareholder's meeting on March 5,
2007, our shareholders approved a new plan, the Whole Foods Market 2007 Stock Incentive Plan. The fiscal year 2007 options were granted pursuant to this new plan. Our Company has, in connection with
certain of our business combinations, assumed the stock option plans of the acquired companies. All options outstanding under our Company's previous plans and plans assumed in business combinations
continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of those grants. Under these plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the grant date and are
generally exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from grant date. Options granted in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 expire five years from the date of grant and options
granted in fiscal year 2005 expire seven years from date of grant. Certain options granted during fiscal year 2005 were granted fully vested. The market value of the stock is determined as the closing
stock price at the grant date. At September 30, 2007, September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005 approximately 5.5 million, 6.5 million and 7.7 million shares
of our common stock, respectively, were available for future stock option grants.

exercise, represented in the table above, was approximately $45.3 million during fiscal year 2007. Total gross unrecognized share-based payments expense related to nonvested stock options was
approximately $27.5 million as of the end of fiscal year 2007, related to approximately 2.8 million shares. We anticipate this expense to be recognized over a weighted average period of
approximately two years.

        Share-based
payments expense related to vesting stock options recognized during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 totaled approximately $8.1 million and $4.6 million,
respectively. 
        During
fiscal year 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options, except options held by the members of the executive team and certain options held by team
members in the United Kingdom, in order to prevent past option grants from having an impact on future results. The Company recognized a share-based payments charge totaling approximately
$17.4 million related to this acceleration, which was determined by measuring the intrinsic value on the date of the acceleration for all options that would have expired in the future
unexercisable had the acceleration not occurred. The calculation of this charge required that management make estimates and assumptions concerning future team member turnover. During fiscal year 2007
and fiscal year 2006 the Company recognized an additional $4.4 million and $3.0 million share-based payments charge, respectively, related to this acceleration to adjust for actual
experience. Additional adjustments in future periods may be necessary as actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions. 
        The
Company also recognized share-based payments expense totaling approximately $0.3 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million for modifications of terms of certain
stock option grants and other compensation based on the intrinsic value of the Company's common stock during fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
        During
fiscal year 2007, the Company issued 4,500 stock options to the Whole Planet Foundation. These options were granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at
the grant date and are exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from grant date and have a five-year life. The total grant-date fair value of
$61,000 was expensed in fiscal year 2007 as a charitable contribution. 
        The
fair value of stock option grants has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

        Risk-free
interest rate is based on the US treasury yield curve on the date of the grant for the time period equal to the expected term of the grant for fiscal years 2007 and
2006 and the seven-year zero coupon treasury bill rate on the date of the grant for fiscal year 2005. Expected volatility is calculated using a ratio of implied volatility based on
comparable Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities ("LEAPS") and four-year historical volatility for fiscal years 2007 and 2006. The Company determined the use of implied
volatility versus historical volatility represents a more accurate calculation of option fair value. In fiscal year 2005, expected volatility was calculated using the daily historical volatility over
the last seven years. Expected life is calculated in two tranches based on weighted average percentage of unexpired options and exercise-after-vesting information over the last five years for fiscal
years 2007 and 2006. During fiscal year 2005, expected life was calculated in five salary tranches based on weighted average exercise-after-vesting information over the last seven years. Unvested
options are included in the term calculation using the "mid-point scenario" which assumes that unvested options will be exercised half-way between vest and expiration date. The
assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and experience. 
        In
addition to the above valuation assumptions, SFAS No. 123R requires the company to estimate an annual forfeiture rate for unvested options and true up fair value expense
accordingly. The company monitors actual forfeiture experience and adjusts the rate from time to time as necessary. 
        Prior
to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied APB No. 25 and related interpretations for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the
compensation expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant.

Team Member Stock Purchase Plan  
        Our Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full-time team members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Participating team
members may purchase our common stock through payroll deductions. At our annual shareholders' meeting, on March 5, 2007, shareholders approved a new TMSPP which became effective on
April 1, 2007. The TMSPP replaces all previous stock purchase plans and provides for a 5% discount on the shares purchase date market value which meets the "Safe Harbor" provisions of SFAS
No. 123R and therefore is non-compensatory. Under the previous plans, participating team members could elect to purchase unrestricted shares at 100% of market value or restricted
shares at 85% of market value on the purchase date. 
        In
fiscal years 2007 and 2006, we recognized approximately $0.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of share-based payments expense related to team member stock
purchase plan discounts. We issued approximately 83,000, 51,000 and 40,000 shares under this plan in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At September 30, 2007, September 24,
2006 and September 25, 2005 approximately 286,000, 369,000, and 420,000 shares of our common stock, respectively, were available for future issuance. 
 
 
(14) Team Member 401(k) Plan     
        Our Company offers a team member 401(k) plan to all team members with a minimum of 1,000 services hours in one year. In fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
Company made a matching contribution to the plan of approximately $2.3 million in cash. 
 
 
(15) Quarterly Results (unaudited)     
        The Company's first quarter consists of 16 weeks, and the second, third and fourth quarters consist of 12 weeks. Fiscal year 2007 is a 53-week year
with thirteen weeks in the fourth quarter. 2006 is a 52-week year with twelve weeks in the fourth quarter. Because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters, it typically
represents a larger share of our annual sales from existing stores. Quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store
openings. The Company believes that the following information reflects all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The operating
results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period.

(16) Commitments and Contingencies     
        The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers' compensation, general
liability, property insurance, director and officers' liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company
are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the
estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 
        From
time to time we are a party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in
the ordinary course of business which have not resulted in any material losses to date. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and
expenses related to pending or future proceedings. 
        On
July 17, 2007, the Company announced that the Company's Board of Directors had formed a Special Committee to perform an independent internal investigation regarding the online
financial message board postings related to Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Markets and retained the firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson LLP to advise it during its investigation. The result of the
Company's internal investigation had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2007. Additionally, the Company announced that it has been
contacted by the staff of the SEC regarding an inquiry related to the same matter. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC as they work through their inquiry. As of the date of this filing, the
SEC's inquiry is not complete. 
        The
Company has entered into Retention Agreements with certain executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries which provide for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of
employment, other than for cause, after a "Triggering Event." A Triggering Event includes a merger of the Company with and into an unaffiliated corporation if the Company is not the surviving
corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. The benefits to be received by the executive officer whose employment is terminated after a Triggering Event occurs include
receipt of his or her annual salary through the one-year period following the date of the termination of employment and the immediate vesting of any outstanding stock options granted to
such executive officer.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.     
        None. 
 
  Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.     
 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     
        The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as
of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
 
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     
        There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting     
        The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        Management's
assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Wild Oats Markets, Inc. ("Wild
Oats"), which is included in our 2007 consolidated financial statements. The Company completed the acquisition of Wild Oats on August 28, 2007. Wild Oats constituted 9% of Company total assets
and 2% of Company net assets as of September 30, 2007. Wild Oats also constituted 2% of Company revenues and 2% of Company net income for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. 
        Under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, the Company's management concluded that its internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2007. 
        The
Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, audited management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting and also independently
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP has issued their attestation report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Report on
Form 10-K. 
 
  Item 9B. Other Information.     
        Not applicable.
