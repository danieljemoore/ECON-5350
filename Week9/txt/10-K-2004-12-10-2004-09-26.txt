  This Report on Form 10-K contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 concerning our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the future. These forward-looking statements are based on
currently available operating, financial and competitive information and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. See “Item 1.
Business - Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results.” for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business.    PART I   



Item 1.
Business.    General    Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns
and operates the largest chain of natural and organic food stores. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well-being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Since the purity of our food and the
health of our bodies are directly related to the purity and health of our environment, our core mission is devoted to the promotion of organically grown foods, food safety concern and sustainability of our entire eco-system. Through our growth, we
have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last 24 years.    Whole Foods Market, Inc. is a Texas corporation incorporated in 1980. Whole Foods Market is based in Austin, Texas and conducts business
through various wholly-owned subsidiaries. Unless otherwise specified, references in this Report to Whole Foods Market or the Company include its consolidated subsidiaries. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods
supermarkets.    We opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980. As of
September 26, 2004, we operated 163 stores: 154 stores in 28 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; two stores in Canada; and seven stores in the United Kingdom. Our sales have grown rapidly through new store openings, acquisitions and comparable
store sales growth, from approximately $92 million in fiscal year 1991, excluding the effect of pooling-of-interests transactions completed since 1991, to approximately $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2004, a compounded annual growth rate of
approximately 33%. Our stores average approximately 32,000 square feet in size and approximately $25 million in annual sales. Our stores are supported by regional distribution centers, bakehouse facilities, commissary kitchens, seafood-processing
facilities, produce procurement centers and a coffee roasting operation.    Our
goal is to become an international brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods, but with being the best food retailer in every community in which we are located. We believe our heavy emphasis on perishable products is helping us reach
that goal, differentiating our stores from conventional supermarkets and enabling us to attract a broader customer base. Perishable product sales accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales in fiscal year 2004. We believe that all
shoppers, not just natural and organic food shoppers, appreciate great produce, dairy, meat, seafood, bakery and prepared foods, and it is our strength of execution in perishables that has attracted many of our most loyal customers.    The Natural Products Industry    According to a leading trade publication for the industry, sales of natural products across
all channels grew to over $43 billion in 2003, an 8% increase over the prior year. The natural and organic products we offer in our stores include food and beverages, dietary supplements, personal care products, household goods, and related
educational products. We believe that sales growth for natural and organic foods is being driven by numerous factors, including:   


 
•
heightened awareness of the role that food and nutrition play in long-term health, which has led to healthier eating patterns;   


 
•
a better-educated populace whose median age is increasing each year;   


 
•
increasing consumer concern over the purity and safety of food due to the presence of pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and other chemicals, and
genetically engineered ingredients; and   


 
•
environmental concerns due to the degradation of water and soil quality.

Table of Contents
Natural foods can be defined as foods that are minimally processed, largely or completely free of artificial ingredients,
preservatives and other non-naturally occurring chemicals and as near to their whole, natural state as possible. Organic products are grown through methods intended to support and enhance the earth’s natural balance. Generally, organic food
products are produced using:   


 
•
agricultural management practices intended to promote and enhance eco-system health;   


 
•
no genetically-engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting pesticides, herbicides or fungicides;   


 
•
livestock management practices intended to promote healthy, humanely treated animals by providing organically-grown feed, fresh air and outdoor access while using no antibiotics or
growth hormones; and   


 
•
food processing practices intended to protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) or synthetic
preservatives.    Organic Rule    On October 21, 2002, the United States Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”)
Organic Rule was implemented into Federal law. The Organic Rule was created to address the rapid, consistent growth of the organics industry over the past 20-plus years and the need for a set of national organic standards to serve as clear
guidelines as to what is considered organic for the industry and its customers. Under the Organic Rule, all products labeled as “organic” in any form must now be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. Furthermore, retailers,
including Whole Foods Market, which handle, store, and sell organic products must implement measures to protect their organic integrity by:   


 
•
preventing the commingling of organic and conventional products;   


 
•
protecting organic products from contact with prohibited substances (such as sanitation and pest control products);   


 
•
labeling organic products properly and clearly; and   


 
•
keeping proper records with regard to organic handling procedures and vendor relationships.    Whole Foods Market has taken an active leadership role in the development of the national organic standards. Margaret Wittenberg, our Vice
President of Marketing and Public Affairs, served on the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) from 1995 to 2000. The NOSB members were appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture to act as industry advisors to the USDA’s National Organic
Program, developing the standards and protocols that form the backbone of the USDA’s Organic Rule. As the sole retail representative on the NOSB, Ms. Wittenberg contributed a broad, realistic perspective on how the standards could work most
effectively at the retail level.    Whole Foods Market has been devoted to
protecting organic integrity for years, and we are pleased to have the USDA’s Organic Rule as a guiding standard. In May of 2003, Whole Foods Market became America’s first national “Certified Organic” grocer through certification
from Quality Assurance International (“QAI”), a federally recognized independent third-party certification organization. This voluntary certification tells our customers that we have gone the extra mile by not only following the
USDA’s Organic Rule, but following a strict set of operating procedures designed to ensure that the products we sell and label as organic are indeed organic – procedures that are not specifically required by the Organic Rule. 
  QAI’s Organic Certification Program for Retailers verifies businesses handle organic
goods according to stringent national guidelines, from receipt through re-packing to final sale to customers. To receive certification, retailers must agree to adhere to a strict set of standards set forth by the USDA, submit documentation, and open
their facilities to on-site inspections – all designed to assure Americans that the chain of organic integrity is preserved. The certification is one more example of our commitment to the promotion of organic agriculture and the integrity of
the certified organic label. Based on QAI’s annual review of our operating procedures, including inspections of our stores and warehouses, our certification is extended through July 2005.    Business Strategy     Whole Foods Market is the largest retailer of natural and organic products. We believe that
much of our success to date is because we remain a uniquely mission-driven company. We are highly selective about what we sell. We believe in providing

Table of Contents

an empowering work environment for our team members, and we are committed to sustainable agriculture. We believe in a virtuous circle entwining the food
chain, human beings, and the earth; each reliant upon the other through a delicate symbiosis.    Whole Foods    We obtain our products
locally and from all over the world, often from small, uniquely dedicated food artisans. We strive to offer the highest quality, least processed, most flavorful and naturally preserved foods. We believe that food in its purest state –
unadulterated by artificial additives, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives – is the best tasting and most nutritious food available.    Whole People    We recruit the best people we can to become part of our team. We empower them to make many operational decisions, creating a respectful workplace where team members are treated fairly and are highly motivated to
succeed. We look for team members who are passionate about food but also well-rounded human beings who can play a critical role in helping to build our stores into profitable and beneficial parts of their communities.    Whole Planet    We believe companies, like individuals, must assume their share of responsibility for our planet. We actively support organic farming on a
global basis because we believe it is the best method for promoting sustainable agriculture and protecting the environment and farm workers. On a local basis, we are actively involved in our communities by supporting food banks, sponsoring
neighborhood events, and contributing at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to not-for-profit organizations.    Core Values    Our core values reflect what is truly important to us as an organization. They are the underpinning of our corporate culture and the soul of our Company. They transcend our size and growth rate, so regardless of how
large we become, by maintaining our core values, we are able to preserve what has always been special about our Company. Our five stated core values include:   


 
•
selling the highest quality natural and organic products available;   


 
•
satisfying and delighting our customers;   


 
•
team member happiness and excellence;   


 
•
creating wealth through profits and growth; and   


 
•
caring about our communities and our environment.    These core values speak to our belief in a balanced way of doing business. We consider all five equal in importance and deserving of equal consideration and attention. We
believe that, together, our focus on natural and organic products, our loyal customers, creative team members, shareholders who support our mission, and communities that welcome our participation set us apart from other natural and conventional food
retailers.    Growth Strategy    Whole Foods Market’s growth strategy is to expand through a combination of new store
openings and acquisitions of existing stores. We have a disciplined, opportunistic real estate and acquisition strategy, opening or acquiring stores in existing trade areas as well as new markets. Our new stores typically range between 40,000 to
60,000 square feet and are located on premium real estate sites. We have also grown through acquisitions, with approximately 33% of our store base consisting of acquired stores. Because the natural foods retailing industry is highly fragmented and
comprised of many smaller local and regional chains, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of smaller chains that provide access to desirable markets, locations and experienced team members. Such acquisitions, however, are expected to have less of
an impact on our future store growth and financial results than they have had in the past primarily due to the growing base size of the Company.

Table of Contents
We typically relocate a small number of our stores each fiscal year to larger locations with improved visibility and
parking. For stores relocated in fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the overall average increase in size was approximately 95%. Our historical store growth is summarized below:

   As of November 10, 2004, we had signed
leases for 53 stores averaging approximately 49,000 square feet in size, which is approximately 55% larger than our existing store base average. Square footage under development at November 10, 2004 was approximately 2.6 million, equal to
approximately 50% of our existing store base.    Products    We have a broad product selection with a strong emphasis on perishable foods designed to
appeal to both natural foods and gourmet shoppers. Most of our products are from natural food vendors; however, we do sell a limited selection of conventional national brands that meet our quality standards.    Quality Standards    A primary part of our Company mission is to promote vitality and well-being for all individuals by supplying the highest quality, most
wholesome foods available. We evaluate quality in terms of nutrition, freshness, appearance and taste. Our search for quality is a never-ending process involving the careful judgment of buyers throughout the Company.   


 
•
We carefully evaluate each and every product that we sell.   


 
•
We feature foods that are free from artificial preservatives, colors, flavors and sweeteners.   


 
•
We are passionate about great tasting food and the pleasure of sharing it with each other.   


 
•
We are committed to foods that are fresh, wholesome and safe to eat.   


 
•
We seek out and promote organically grown foods.   


 
•
We strive to provide food and nutritional products that support health and well-being.    Our standards require that seafood comes from deep, clean, clear waters or from aquaculture farms where environmental concerns are a
priority, and our seafood is never treated with chlorine or other chemicals, which is common practice in the food retailing industry. In addition, Whole Foods Market has championed innovative production standards to improve the quality and safety of
the meat and poultry sold in our stores, while also supporting the better treatment and health of the animals. Animal welfare requirements currently mandatory for any meat and poultry sold by the Whole Foods Market include:   


 
•
no antibiotics or added growth hormones;   


 
•
an annual affidavit from each producer outlining the raising and handling practices, feed, facility design, environmental conditions, employee training, medical practices and animal
welfare at the farm, in transportation and throughout processing;   


 
•
annual inspection of each producer by Whole Foods Market; and   


 
•
successful completion of an independent third-party food safety audit of each processing plant and a humane slaughter audit according to a rating system developed by renowned animal
welfare and facility design expert Dr. Temple Grandin.

Table of Contents
In October 2003, we announced plans to create farm animal treatment standards that go above and beyond these existing
strict standards. The new standards of production and processing are being developed in cooperation with producers, animal welfare advocacy groups, animal welfare scientists, and an independent third-party food safety auditor. The next phase of our
animal welfare standards underscores the Company’s belief that the needs of an animal should be the first criteria in the development of standards, with focus on providing environments and conditions for each species that support the
animal’s natural physical needs, behavior and well-being. Products meeting the utmost standard will be labeled “animal compassionate.” Work on our new “animal compassionate” standards started in November 2003 with the
development of enhanced animal welfare standards for ducks. Work is continuing on enhanced standards for pigs and sheep, with the development of standards for other species to follow.    Product Categories    Our product categories include, but are not limited to: produce, seafood, grocery, meat and poultry, bakery, prepared foods and catering, specialty (beer, wine and
cheese), whole body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, body care and educational products such as books), floral, pet products and household products.    Perishable products, defined as food and other products subject to spoilage, accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales in fiscal year 2004, up from
approximately 57% of our total retail sales 10 years ago. We believe our heavy emphasis on perishable products differentiates us from conventional supermarkets and helps us to attract a broader customer base. We believe that all shoppers, not just
natural and organic food shoppers, appreciate great produce, dairy, meat, seafood, bakery and prepared foods. We believe it is our strength of execution in perishables that has attracted many of our most loyal shoppers.    Private Label Products    Because of the relative lack of national brands within the natural products marketplace, we believe we have a unique private label
opportunity. We have taken advantage of this opportunity and over the last several years have expanded our private label offerings, which currently feature over 1,000 SKUs and comprise four corporate brands (365 Everyday Value, Whole Kids Organic,
365 Organic and the Whole Brands family), as well as the Authentic Food Artisan (AFA) program. In addition to these nationally-driven programs, we have a number of store-made and regionally-made fresh items sold under the Whole Foods Market label.
We also offer specialty and organic coffees and teas through our Allegro Coffee Company subsidiary. Our private label sales in grocery and nutrition accounted for approximately 14% of our total sales in those product categories in fiscal year 2004.
  


 
•
365 Everyday Value. In 1997, we introduced a line of products under the “365” label emphasizing everyday value. These products meet our quality standards but are
generally less expensive than the alternative products we sell. Our qualitative and quantitative research indicates that the “365” line is a highly recognized and trusted brand with Whole Foods Market shoppers.   


 
•
Whole Kids Organic. In 1998, we introduced the country’s first organic food product line developed just for children under the “Whole Kids” label. Whole Kids
Organic offers great tasting items, from applesauce and peanut butter to pasta sauce and string cheese, crafted expressly for a child’s discerning palate.   


 
•
365 Organic Everyday Value. In 2002, we expanded our private label program with the introduction of our “365 Organic” line. The “365 Organic” brand
provides all of the benefits of organic food at reduced prices. Certified organic products are purchased in large quantities so that the savings may be passed on to our customers. In 2003, we expanded this program into non-grocery departments,
including a successful line of organic fresh vegetables.    


 
•
Authentic Food Artisan. In 2003, we introduced our Authentic Food Artisan (AFA) program. This program recognizes distinctive products that are made using traditional methods.
Potential items for the AFA program are reviewed on a quarterly basis, specifically chosen for their superior taste and commitment to artisanal, small-scale production methods. The line includes olive oils, cheese, wine, pasta, vinegar, rice and
honey, among other items.   


 
•
 Whole Brands. In September 2004, we introduced a new family of “Whole Brands,” each aligned with department-specific quality and sourcing
standards. Included under the “Whole Brands” umbrella are “Whole Kitchen” for frozen grocery, “Whole Treat” for frozen desserts and candies, “Whole Catch” for frozen seafood items, and “Whole Fields”
for produce and produce support items. These brands go beyond the basics, offering unique items that embody our high 
  
7 


Table of Contents


 
 
quality standards and supplement our base value line of 365 and 365 Organic items. Items in the “Whole” family share a consistent logo format and
packaging so that our customers know each is part of a greater family.     Store Operations    Team Approach to
Store Operations    We strive to promote a strong company culture featuring
a team approach to store operations that we believe is distinctly more empowering of employees than that of the traditional supermarket. Our domestic stores each employ between 80 and 485 team members who are organized into up to 11 teams per store,
each led by a team leader. Each team within a store is responsible for a different product category or aspect of store operations such as customer service, prepared foods, or grocery, among other things. Together with our regional framework, we
promote a decentralized team approach to store operations in which many of the personnel, merchandising and operating decisions are made by teams at the individual store level. Because of our management structure, an effective store team leader is
critical to the success of the store. The store team leader works closely with one or more associate store team leaders, as well as with all of the department team leaders, to operate the store as efficiently and profitably as possible. Members of
store leadership are paid a salary plus an Economic Value Added (“EVA”™) based bonus and are eligible to receive stock options.    We believe team members are inspired by work that provides them with a greater sense of purpose and mission. For many team members, their job with us is an extension of their personal philosophy and lifestyle. Many team members have said
they are contributing to the good of others by selling clean and nutritious foods, by contributing to long-term sustainable agriculture and by promoting a pesticide-free and healthier environment. For the past seven years, our team members have
helped Fortune magazine select us as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work for in America.”    Every year our team members have the opportunity to complete a Morale Survey. In 2004, the overall participation rate was 63%. Topics covered by the survey include job satisfaction, opportunity and empowerment, pay,
training and benefits. Of the team members responding in 2004, 86% said they almost always or frequently enjoy their job (level with last year), and 82% said they almost always or frequently feel empowered to do their best work at Whole Foods Market
(up from 81% last year). In response to the question, “What is the best thing about working at Whole Foods Market?,” common responses included co-workers, customers, flexibility, work environment, growth and learning opportunities, the
products we sell, benefits, the team concept, and culture of empowerment.    We
strive to create a Company-wide consciousness of “shared fate” by uniting the self-interests of team members as closely as possible to the self-interests of our shareholders. One way we reinforce this concept is through a gainsharing
program rewarding a team’s labor productivity. We also encourage stock ownership among team members through the following programs:   


 
•
Team Member Stock Option Plan. Team members are eligible for stock options through seniority, promotion or at the discretion of senior regional or national leadership.
  


 
•
Team Member Stock Purchase Plan. Team members can purchase restricted stock at a discount (or unrestricted stock without a discount) through payroll deductions.
  


 
•
Team Member 401(k) Plan. Whole Foods Market stock is an investment option within the Company’s 401(k) plan.    Store Description    We do not have a standard store design model. Instead, each store’s design is customized to fit the size and configuration of the
particular location and community in which it is located. We strive to transform food shopping from a chore into a dynamic experience by building and operating stores with colorful décor, well-trained team members, exciting product mixes,
teams of in-store chefs, ever-changing selections, samples, open kitchens, scratch bakeries, hand-stacked produce, prepared foods stations and European-style charcuterie departments. To further a sense of community and interaction with customers,
our stores typically include sit-down eating areas, customer comment boards and customer service booths. We have “Take Action” centers for our customers who want to be informed on important issues relative to environmental, legislative,
food safety and product quality issues that can directly affect our customers’ health and well-being. In addition, some stores offer special services such as massage, valet parking and home delivery. We believe our stores play a unique role as
a third place, besides the home and office, where people can gather, interact and learn while at the same time discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food.

Table of Contents
Site Selection    Most of our stores are located in high-traffic shopping areas and are either freestanding or in a strip center. We also have a small number of urban stores located in
high-density, mixed-use projects. In selecting store locations, we use an internally developed model to analyze potential markets based on various criteria such as education levels, population density and income levels. Approximately 86% of our
existing U.S. stores are located in the top 50 statistical metropolitan areas. We primarily seek to open large format stores, which range in size between 40,000 to 60,000 square feet and are located on premier real estate sites, often in urban,
high-population locales. After we have selected a target site, our development group does a comprehensive site study and sales projection. Each project must meet an internal EVA hurdle return, which is generally cumulative positive EVA within five
to seven years.     Based on past experience, approximately 55% of our
stores open within 12 to 24 months after the signing of a new store lease is announced. For stores signed, announced and opened over the past 10 years, the median length of time was 17 months. The required cash investment for new stores varies
depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Over the past three fiscal years, our new store investment has averaged approximately $8.2 million. This
excludes new store inventory of approximately $800,000, a portion of which is financed by our vendors, and pre-opening expenses, which have averaged approximately $640,000 per store over the past three fiscal years.    Purchasing and Distribution    Our buyers purchase products for retail sale from local, regional and international
wholesale suppliers and vendors. Over the last few years, we have shifted the majority of our purchasing operations from the store to the regional and national level. Increased purchasing on a regional and national level enables us to negotiate
better volume discounts with major vendors and distributors, and allows regional and store buyers to focus on local products and the unique product mix necessary to keep a neighborhood market feel in our stores. We own two produce procurement
centers which facilitate the procurement and distribution of the majority of the produce we sell. In addition, we operate three seafood processing and distribution facilities and a specialty coffee roaster and distributor. We also have six regional
commissaries and 12 bakehouse facilities, all of which distribute products to our stores. Other products are typically procured through a combination of specialty wholesalers and direct distributors. We operate 10 regional distribution centers,
distributing a full range of products to our stores across the U.S., Canada and United Kingdom.    United Natural Foods is our single largest supplier, accounting for approximately 20% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2004.    Marketing    We spend less on advertising and marketing than conventional supermarkets – approximately 0.5% of our total sales in fiscal year 2004, instead relying primarily on
word-of-mouth recommendations from our customers. We allocate our marketing budget among region-wide programs, our individual stores’ marketing efforts, and a national brand awareness initiative focusing primarily on national and major market
public relations and consumer research. Our stores spend most of their marketing budgets on in-store marketing-related activities, including signage and in-store events such as taste fairs, classes, tours and product samplings. To create goodwill
and develop a high profile within the community, each store also has a separate budget for making contributions to a variety of philanthropic and community activities. We presently contribute at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash
or products to not-for-profit organizations.    Customer Service
   One of our core values as a company is to satisfy and delight our
customers. We want to meet or exceed their expectations on every shopping trip. We believe that by doing so we turn customers into advocates for our business, who do more than shop with us; they talk about Whole Foods Market to their friends and
others. We want to serve our customers competently, efficiently, and knowledgeably. We believe that we generate greater appreciation and loyalty from our customers by educating them about natural and organic foods, health, nutrition and the
environment through our in-store “Take Action” centers as well as on our corporate Web site at www.wholefoodsmarket.com, which features hundreds of recipes and a library of information about environmental, legislative, food safety and
product quality issues.    Team Members    As of September 26, 2004, we had approximately 32,100 team members, including 27,600
full-time, 2,900 part-time and 1,600 temporary team members. We are proud that approximately 90% of our permanent team members are full-time team members, which we believe is very high for the food retailing industry. All of our full-time and
part-time team members are eligible to receive stock options. One of our core values is team member happiness and excellence, and for the past seven

years, our team members have helped Whole Foods Market be selected as one of Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work for in America.”
In scoring companies, Fortune places the greatest weight (two-thirds of the total) on responses to a random survey of employees, with the remainder being Fortune’s evaluation of each company’s benefits and practices. We are the only
national food retailer to make the list, and we are one of only 24 companies to make the list every year since its inception. In fiscal year 2003, we conducted our first-ever, Company-wide benefits vote, which gave our team members an opportunity to
take an active role in choosing their benefits by voting on the benefits package they want in place for the next three years. Close to 80% of all eligible full-time and part-time team members participated in the vote.    Unions may from time to time attempt to organize our team members or portions of our team
member base at certain stores or non-retail facilities. In addition, our new and existing stores have been subjected to informational picketing and negative publicity campaigns from time to time by members of various local trade unions. A vote to
appoint the United Food and Commercial Workers (“UFCW”) as legal representative of our Madison, WI store was certified on September 7, 2002; however, after engaging in collective bargaining negotiations through September 2003, team members
at the store presented a petition to us requesting that the UFCW no longer be considered their official bargaining representative. On November 12, 2003, we withdrew recognition from the union. The NLRB rejected the UFCW’s challenge, and we
believe this matter is behind us. We have moved forward with a renewed sense of cooperation and shared vision.    Economic Value Added    We use Economic
Value Added (“EVA”) to evaluate our business decisions and as a basis for determining incentive compensation. In its simplest definition, EVA is equivalent to net operating profits after taxes minus a charge for the cost of capital
necessary to generate those profits. We believe that one of our core strengths is our decentralized culture, where decisions are made at the store level, close to the customer. We believe this is one of our strongest competitive advantages, and that
EVA is the best financial framework that team members can use to help make decisions that create sustainable shareholder value.    We use EVA extensively for capital investment decisions, including evaluating new store real estate decisions and store remodeling proposals. We turn down projects that
we believe will not add long-term value to the Company. The EVA decision-making model also enhances operating decisions in stores. Our emphasis is on EVA improvement, as we want to challenge our teams to continue to innovate and grow EVA in new
ways. We believe that opportunities always exist to increase sales and margins, to lower operating expenses and to make investments that add value in ways that benefit all of our stakeholders. We believe that focusing on EVA improvement encourages
continuous improvement of our business.    Over 500 leaders throughout the
Company are on EVA-based incentive compensation plans, of which the primary measure is EVA improvement. EVA-based plans cover our senior executive leadership, regional leadership and the store leadership team in all stores. Incentive compensation
for each of these groups is determined based on relevant EVA measures at different levels, including the total company level, the regional level, the store or facility level, and the team level. We believe using EVA in a multi-dimensional approach
best measures the results of decisions made at different levels of the Company. We expect to continue to expand the use of EVA as a significant component of our compensation structure throughout the Company in the coming years.    Information about our EVA financial results is not presented in consideration of rules
adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding non-GAAP financial measures. Additional information about our EVA financial results is available on our corporate Web site at www.wholefoodsmarket.com and is not
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.    Competition 
  Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competition varies from
region to region and includes local, regional and national conventional and specialty supermarkets, smaller specialty stores, and restaurants, each of which competes with us on the basis of price, quality or a combination of both. We believe our
focus on quality and service differentiates us in this segmented marketplace.    Natural and organic foods are one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Most supermarkets offer at least a limited selection of these products, while some have chosen to expand their selection more aggressively. We
believe it works to our benefit for conventional supermarkets to offer natural and organic products for two reasons: first, it helps fulfill our company mission of improving the health, well-being and healing of both people and the planet, and
second, it helps create new customers for us by creating a gateway experience. As more people are exposed to the benefits of natural and organic products, they are more likely to become Whole Foods Market customers because we are the category leader
for natural and organic products, offering what we believe is the largest selection and most informed customer service at competitive prices.

Government and Public Affairs    Our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must
comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages.    The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products
are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), the United States
Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act (“FFDC Act”). The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. We believe we are in material
compliance with product labeling requirements.    Margaret Wittenberg, our Vice
President of Marketing and Public Affairs, has served on numerous government boards and industry committees to create and strengthen the USDA’s Organic Rule and to counsel the USDA and the EPA on pesticide tolerance levels, the use and labeling
of GMOs in the food chain, and preserving marine fisheries.    Trademarks
   Trademarks owned by the Company or its subsidiaries include, but are not

focus of our Web site is customer service. We believe our Web site provides us with an opportunity to further our relationships with customers, suppliers and investors, to educate them on a variety of issues, and to improve our service levels.
   We have included our Web site address only as an inactive textual reference.
The information contained on our Web site is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.    Additional Factors that May Affect Future Results    We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward-looking statements that we make from time to time in filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking statements made from time to time by representatives of the Company.
These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The cautionary
statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.
   Our Growth Is Partially Dependent on New Store Openings and Acquisitions
   Our strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings
and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions of existing stores. Successful implementation of this strategy is contingent on numerous conditions, some of which are described below, and there can be no assurance that our expansion strategy can be
successfully executed.    Our continued growth depends to a significant degree on
our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new markets and to operate these stores successfully. Our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations, and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites.
We may not be able to timely open new stores or operate them

Table of Contents

successfully. In addition, we may not be able to successfully hire and train new team members or integrate those team members into the programs and policies
of the Company. We may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable
manner.    There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through
acquisitions. For the acquisitions that we do make, we may not be able to successfully integrate those businesses into our operations and support systems, or the operations of acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the introduction of our
decentralized operational approach. The integration of acquired operations into our operations requires the dedication of management resources that may temporarily detract attention from our day-to-day business.    We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Comparable Store Sales 
  Our comparable store sales in the future could fluctuate or be lower than our historical
average for many reasons including new and acquired stores entering into the comparable store base, the opening of new stores that cannibalize store sales in existing markets, increased competition, price changes in response to competitive factors,
possible supply shortages, and cycling against above-average sales results in the prior year. Results of operations may be materially impacted by fluctuations in our comparable store sales as it becomes more difficult to leverage expenses at a lower
level of sales.    We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Quarterly
Operating Results    Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate for
many reasons, including losses from new stores, variations in the mix of product sales, price changes in response to competitive factors, increases in store operating costs, possible supply shortages, extreme weather-related disruptions, and
potential uninsured casualty losses or other losses. In addition, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as the result of the timing of new store openings, the timing of acquisitions, the range of operating results generated
from newly opened stores and changes in estimates associated with the disposal of discontinued operations. Quarter-to-quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings.
   Increased Competition May Have an Adverse Effect on Profitability
   Our competitors currently include other natural foods supermarkets,
conventional and specialty supermarkets, other natural foods stores, small specialty stores and restaurants. These businesses compete with us in one or more product categories. In addition, some traditional and specialty supermarkets are expanding
more aggressively in marketing a range of natural foods, thereby competing directly with us for products, customers and locations. Some of these potential competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater financial or marketing
resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Increased competition may have an adverse effect on profitability as the result of lower sales, lower gross profits and/or greater
operating costs such as marketing.    Our Business May be Sensitive to
Economic Conditions that Impact Consumer Spending    Our results of
operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions,
interest rates and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to our competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors
could adversely affect our growth and profitability.    Legal Proceedings
Could Materially Impact Our Results    From time to time, we are party to
legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results
could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.    We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People Are Harmed By the Products We Sell    There is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. We believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of their
interest in health, nutrition and food safety. We believe that our customers hold us to a higher food safety standard than conventional supermarkets. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in product liability
claims, the settlement or outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations.   
12 


Table of Contents
The Loss of Key Management Could Negatively Affect Our Business    We are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we were to lose
the services of a significant number of key team members within a short period of time, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member. Our continued success is also dependent
upon our ability to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We face intense competition for qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing employers. We may not be able to attract and
retain necessary team members to operate our business.    Union Attempts to
Organize Our Team Members and Informational Picketing May Disrupt Our Business    Unions have from time to time attempted to organize our team members or portions of our team member base at certain stores and non-retail facilities. Responding to such organization attempts requires substantial management and team member
time and can be disruptive to operations. In addition, our new and existing stores have from time to time been subjected to informational picketing and negative publicity campaigns by members of various local trade unions. Any of these union
activities may have a negative financial effect on a store, facility or the Company as a whole.    Unfavorable Changes in Government Regulation Could Harm Our Business    Our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food
labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages. Our new store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our
ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses.    The
manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the FDA, FTC, CPSC, USDA and EPA. The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are
most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the FFDC Act. The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education
Act.    The USDA’s Organic Rule, implemented into federal law on October 21,
2002, should facilitate interstate commerce and the marketing of fresh and processed food that is organically produced and should also provide an assurance to our customers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with this
rule might pose a significant burden on some of our suppliers, which may cause a disruption in some of our product offerings.    We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations or
administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall
or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all of such
requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Changes in the Availability of Quality Natural and Organic Products Could Impact Our Business    There is no assurance that quality natural and organic products will be available to meet our future needs. If conventional supermarkets increase their natural and
organic product offerings or if new laws require the reformulation of certain products to meet tougher standards, the supply of these products may be constrained. Any significant disruption in the supply of quality natural and organic products could
have a material impact on our overall sales and cost of goods.    Perishable
Foods Product Losses Could Materially Impact Our Results    We believe our
stores more heavily emphasize perishable products than conventional supermarket stores. Perishable products accounted for approximately 67% of our total retail sales in fiscal year 2004. The Company’s emphasis on perishable products may result
in significant product inventory losses in the event of extended power outages, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences.    Our Stock Price Is Volatile    The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events. These market factors and events include
variations in our earnings results, changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, publicity regarding us, our competitors, the natural products industry generally, new statutes or regulations or 
  
13 


Table of Contents

changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the natural products industry specifically, sales of substantial amounts of
common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur and other factors.    In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations also may
adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Volatility in the price of our common stock, changes in prevailing interest rates and changes in perception of our creditworthiness may adversely affect the price of our convertible subordinated
debentures.    Changes in the Amount of Stock Option Exercises Could Impact
Our Cash Flows    Our cash flows from the exercise of team member stock
options may be adversely affected in the future by fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, changes in income tax law, and changes in the number of stock options we grant.    Capital Needed for Expansion May Not Be Available    The acquisition of existing stores, the opening of new stores, and the development of new production and distribution facilities require
significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through proceeds from public offerings, bank debt, private placements of debt and internally generated cash flow. These and other sources of capital may not be
available to us in the future. In addition, restrictive covenants that may be imposed by our lenders may restrict our ability to fund our growth.    Information System Upgrades or Integrations May Disrupt Our Operations or Financial Reporting    We continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, and the
information systems at some of the acquired operations have not been fully integrated with our information systems. Although we do not anticipate any disruption in our operations or financial reporting as a result of system upgrades or system
integrations, there can be no assurance that such disruption will not occur or that the desired benefits from the system upgrades will be realized.    We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights   
We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright law and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. There
can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products may be produced or
sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.    Self-Insurance Plan Claims Could Materially Impact Our Results
   The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to
provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks
that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results could be
materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to such plans if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.    Effective Tax Rate Changes and Results of Examinations by Taxing Authorities Could Materially Impact Our Results    Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than
anticipated in states or countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in states or countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in
tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other state and local taxing authorities. Although not currently anticipated by management,
our results could be materially impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.

   As of November 30, 2004, there were
1,703 holders of record of Whole Foods Market’s common stock and the closing stock price was $90.77.    On November 12, 2003, the Company announced its first quarterly cash dividend. The first dividend of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.1 million, was paid on January 16, 2004 to shareholders of record as of January
6, 2004. The second divided of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.2 million, was paid on April 19, 2004 to shareholders of record as of April 9, 2004. The third dividend of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.4 million, was paid on July 19, 2004
to shareholders of record as of July 9, 2004, and the fourth dividend of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.4 million, was paid on October 18, 2004 to shareholders of record as of October 8, 2004. On November 10, 2004, the Company announced a 27%
increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.19 per share. The first $0.19 per share dividend is payable on January 17, 2005 to shareholders of record as of January 7, 2005. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject
to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.    On January 31, 2004, the Company issued 238,735 shares of Company common stock, worth approximately $16 million, in a transaction that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, to persons
reasonably believed to be “accredited investors” (as defined in Regulation D) and paid additional cash to acquire Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited. The Company later filed a Registration Statement under the Securities Act to permit the
resale of the Company shares.    The following table summarizes information about
our Company’s equity compensation plans by type as of September 26, 2004 (in thousands):

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    General    Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well-being for all
individuals by supplying the highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide
acceptance. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 26, 2004, have expanded our operations both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties to 163 stores: 154 stores in 28 U.S. states and the
District of Columbia; two stores in Canada; and seven stores in the United Kingdom. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets.    Our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores
generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on
the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 52-week years.    Executive Summary    Sales for fiscal year 2004 totaled
approximately $3.9 billion, an increase of approximately 23% over the prior year, driven by 9% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 14.9%. We experienced sales growth across all regions, all departments and all
age classes of stores. We set new weekly sales records in 84% of our stores during fiscal year 2004, and we had sales per gross square foot of $786. Sales for fiscal year 2003 totaled approximately $3.1 billion, an increase of approximately 17% over
the prior year, with 11% weighted average square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 8.6%. Sales for fiscal year 2002 totaled approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately 18% over the prior year, with 16% weighted average
square footage growth and comparable store sales growth of 10.0%.    Net income
totaled $137.1 million, $103.7 million and $84.5 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, increasing year-over year by approximately 32%, 23% and 24%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $2.09, $1.66 and $1.40 for fiscal years
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.    Cash flows from operations totaled
approximately $328.8 million, $279.5 million and $229.1 million for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our capital expenditures totaled approximately $265.0 million, $173.1 million and $161.4 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively, including approximately $155.2 million, $89.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively, for new stores. We opened 12 stores during each of fiscal years 2004 and 2003, and opened 11 stores during fiscal year 2002, and we ended fiscal
year 2004 with 163 stores.    Year over year, total assets increased 27% to $1.5
billion, total liabilities increased 26% to $531 million, and shareholders’ equity increased 27% to $988 million. At the end of fiscal year 2004, we had $171 million in long-term debt and $222 million in total cash and cash equivalents,
including restricted cash.    The Company declared its first quarterly cash
dividend of 15 cents per share on November 12, 2003. Four quarterly dividends of 15 cents per share each, or a total of approximately $37.1 million, were declared during fiscal year 2004. The Company announced a 27% increase in the Company’s
quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share on November 10, 2004.

   Figures may not add due to
rounding.    Sales    Sales increased 22.8%, 17.0% and 18.4% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
Sales for all fiscal years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 14.9%, 8.6% and 10.0% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be
comparable commencing in the fifty-third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes sales for remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 14.5%,
8.1%, and 8.7% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Sales from relocations and remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% are excluded from identical store sales data to reduce the impact of square footage growth on
the comparison. Weighted average square footage growth from stores opened and acquired was approximately 9%, 11% and 16% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We believe our comparable store sales growth and the ability to open
successful stores in diverse markets are due to the broad appeal of our stores, natural and organic products entering the mainstream consciousness, improvements in overall store execution and the growing awareness of our brand. Sales for fiscal year
2004 were positively impacted by the United Food and Commercial Workers union strike at conventional grocery store retailers in Southern California during a span of approximately 20 weeks over our first and second quarters. Nineteen of our stores
experienced an increase in sales due to the strike, 18 of which were in the comparable store base during those periods.    Gross Profit    Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation operations. Our gross profit as a percentage of sales was 34.8%, 34.3% and
34.7% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our gross profit may increase or decrease slightly depending on the mix of sales from new stores or the impact of weather or a host of other factors, including inflation. While we always have
initiatives in place to drive better purchasing, we usually pass those savings on to our customers as lower prices. Our pricing strategy continues to be market driven in grocery and Whole Body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, and body care), in
which we aim to be competitively priced on the same or similar items. Our perishables may be priced at a premium to reflect the higher quality of product available in our stores. In all years, gross profit margins were also positively affected by
margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and
operational efficiencies of the store teams.    Direct Store Expenses
   Direct store expenses as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.5%,
25.2% and 25.1% in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For all years, higher direct operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Direct store expense as a percentage of sales
tends to be higher for new stores and decrease as stores mature, reflecting increasing operational productivity of the store teams. We continue to focus on improvements in leveraging of labor, managing health care benefits plan costs and other
direct expenses to produce incremental improvements in direct store expense as a percentage of sales.

Table of Contents
General and Administrative Expenses    General and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were 3.1%, 3.2% and 3.6% in fiscal years 2004, 2003
and 2002, respectively. Fiscal year 2004 and 2003 general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to our strong sales growth and focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses at both regional and national levels.
Fiscal year 2002 general and administrative expenses reflect increased costs of infrastructure for the new South region and increases in other regions and the national office. We continue to focus on leveraging general and administrative expenses as
a percentage of sales, but do not expect significant additional leverage in fiscal year 2005 over leverage generated in fiscal year 2004.    Pre-opening and Relocation Costs    Pre-opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility
openings. Pre-opening costs are incurred primarily in the 30 days prior to a new store or facility opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced
facilities. Pre-opening and relocation costs were approximately $10.5 million, $12.1 million and $12.5 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Stores newly opened and relocated were as follows:

   Interest Expense    Interest expense consists of costs related to our convertible subordinated debentures,
senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was approximately $7.2 million, $8.1 million and $10.4 million
in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These reductions in net interest expense reflect decreased utilization of our bank line of credit and lower average interest rates over the three-year period. We had no amounts outstanding on our
bank line of credit during fiscal years 2004 or 2003.    Investment and Other
Income    Investment and other income includes investment gains and losses,
interest income, rental income and other income totaling approximately $6.5 million, $5.6 million and $2.1 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in unrestricted and
restricted common shares of Gaiam Inc. for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. During fiscal year 2003, we recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $3 million as a result of the distribution of our
ownership share of gain from the sale of Blooming Prairie Cooperative, and pre-tax losses totaling approximately $1.4 million to adjust the carrying value of our common stock investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value for other-than-temporary
impairment due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value.    Income Taxes    Our effective tax rate on
income from continuing operations was approximately 40.0% for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. At September 26, 2004, we had domestic net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $32 million which will expire in 2020. We consider it more
likely than not that all domestic net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized.    Business Combinations    On January 31, 2004, we acquired all of
the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited (“Fresh & Wild”) for a total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. The acquisition of Fresh &
Wild, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, provided a platform for expansion of the Whole Foods Market brand in the United Kingdom. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase
method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired
of approximately $30.5 million have been recorded as goodwill. The Company also agreed to an additional purchase price consideration contingent on the market price of Company common stock at January 31, 2006. If the market price of Company stock at
January 31, 2006 is less than the market price at acquisition of $68.59 per share, those sellers who received and continuously hold through January 31, 2006 Company common stock are eligible to receive an amount, in stock, cash or any combination
thereof, equal to the deficit multiplied by the number of shares continuously held.

Table of Contents
Fresh & Wild results of operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning
February 1, 2004 through September 26, 2004. John Mackey, our Chief Executive Officer and Walter Robb, our Co-President and Chief Operating Officer each owned approximately 0.2% of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild and received proceeds
totaling approximately $54,000 and $78,000, respectively, as consideration for their ownership interest.    On October 27, 2003, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC (“Select Fish”) in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. All assets acquired relate to a
seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired
based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $1.1 million have been recorded as goodwill. Select Fish results of operations are included in our
consolidated income statements for the period beginning October 27, 2003 through September 26, 2004.    On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harry’s Farmers Markets, Inc. in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets
acquired are all assets relating to the three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real estate, the Harry’s Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in
excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of these acquired operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period beginning October 31, 2001
through September 29, 2002 and all subsequent periods.    Liquidity and
Capital Resources    We generated cash flows from operating activities of
approximately $328.8 million, $279.5 million and $229.1 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non-cash
expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital. We had cash and cash equivalent balances, including restricted cash, totaling approximately $221.5 million and
$165.8 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively.    On
October 1, 2004, we amended our credit facility to extend the maturity of our $100 million revolving line of credit to October 1, 2009. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and
certain negative covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness as defined in the agreement. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under
this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees of 0.15% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 no amounts were
drawn under the agreement. The amounts available to the Company under the agreement were effectively reduced to $96.5 million and $80.2 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $3.5 million and $19.8 million at September 26,
2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively.    We have outstanding zero coupon
convertible subordinated debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $158.8 million and $151.4 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a
principal amount at maturity on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures have a
conversion rate of 10.640 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, representing approximately 3,280,000 shares. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued
original discount totaling approximately $188 million and $241 million, respectively. No debentures were redeemed at the option of the holder on the potential redemption date of March 2, 2003. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may
elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to
the date of redemption. The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of
payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness.    We also have
outstanding senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly with a carrying amount of approximately $11.4 million and $17.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. Principal on the

   We periodically make other commitments
and become subject to other contractual obligations that we believe to be routine in nature and incidental to the operation of the business. Management believes that such routine commitments and contractual obligations do not have a material impact
on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    The Company
declared its first quarterly cash dividend of 15 cents per share on November 12, 2003. Four quarterly dividends totaling 60 cents per share, or a total of approximately $37.1 million, were declared during fiscal year 2004. The Company announced a
27% increase in the Company’s quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share on November 10, 2004. The Company will pay future dividends at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The continuation of these payments, the amount of such dividends, and
the form in which the dividends are paid (cash or stock) depend on many factors, including the results of operations and the financial condition of the Company. Subject to these qualifications, the Company currently expects to pay dividends on a
quarterly basis.    Our principal historical capital requirements have been the
funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work
performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Over the past three fiscal years, our new store investment has averaged approximately $8.2 million per location. This excludes new store inventory of approximately $800,000, a
portion of which is financed by our vendors, and pre-opening expenses, which have averaged approximately $640,000 per store over the past three fiscal years. As of November 10, 2004, we had signed leases for 53 stores averaging approximately 49,000
square feet in size. The following table provides information about the Company’s stores under development:

   We will incur additional capital
expenditures during fiscal year 2005 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, the Company loaned $13.5
million to a third-party real estate developer in connection with the construction of a new Company store. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited, which owned and
operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, for a

Table of Contents

total of approximately $20 million in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. During the first quarter of fiscal
year 2004, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC, which owned and operated a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington, in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain
liabilities. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2002, the Company completed the acquisition of three Harry’s Farmer’s Market perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the
assumption of certain liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $319.2 million, $175.8 million and $203.4 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Absent any significant cash acquisition or change in
status of the Company’s outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue, we expect planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash generated from operations. We continually
evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Company’s needs and market conditions.    Critical Accounting Policies    The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and
circumstances.    We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are
appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are
inherently uncertain.    Insurance and Self-Insurance Reserves 
  The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the
potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are
retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for
these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.    Inventory Valuation    We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method for approximately 94.2% and 96.4% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess
of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO reserve, was approximately $11.2 million and $9.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. Costs for the balance of inventories are determined by the first-in,
first-out (“FIFO”) method.    Cost was determined using the retail
method for approximately 50% and 56% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the retail method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio for
various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at
cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately 50% and 44% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning
costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances
and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of accounting. We believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk that inventory values
would be materially misstated.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets
   We review goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit level annually, or
more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value 
  
25

method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our evaluation of goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different
organizational level, could produce significantly different results.    Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    The Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) issued EITF No. 03-10, “Application of Issue No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” in November 2003. EITF Issue No. 03-10 addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales
incentives offered directly to consumers, including manufacturer coupons. EITF Issue No. 03-10 became effective the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 03-10 had no impact on our financial position or
results of operations.    Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements
   Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters
discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration of acquired stores, the
impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, see “Item 1. Business - Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results.” The Company
does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.   



Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.    We are exposed to interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments, notes receivable and long-term debt. We are not a party to any derivative
arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material.    Interest Rate Risk    We seek to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our investments and long-term debt. The Company holds
interest-bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents. These investments are of a short-term nature, and therefore changes in interest rates would not likely have a material impact on the valuation of these instruments or
interest income. We classify our cash equivalent investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, have recorded them at fair value on our balance sheets. We had cash equivalent investments totaling approximately $184.1 million and $162.0 million
at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, our cash equivalent investments earned an average interest rate of approximately 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and
September 28, 2003, an unrealized loss of approximately $0.4 million and an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million, respectively, related to cash equivalent investments was included as a component of shareholders’ equity. Our notes
receivable and senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The notes receivable earn interest at a fixed rate of 3.75% and had a carrying amount and fair
value of approximately $13.5 million at September 26, 2004. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and had an outstanding balance of $11.4 million and $17.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003,
respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $0.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the
estimated fair value of the senior notes would decrease or increase accordingly.    Interest Rate and Market Risk    Our subordinated convertible
debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective
yield to maturity of 5% and had an outstanding balance of approximately $158.8 million and $151.4 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 the estimated fair value of the
convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $137.1 million and $48.9 million, respectively. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon
subordinated debentures would decrease or increase accordingly.    Market Risk
   We regularly review the carrying value of our investments to identify and
record losses when events and circumstances indicate that such declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other-than-temporary. During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in Gaiam, Inc for approximately
$1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. Our investments in Gaiam, Inc., a public company, consisted of 80,000 unrestricted common shares, which were classified as available-for-sale securities and 250,000 restricted common
shares, for which we accounted using the cost method. During fiscal year 2003 we recognized losses totaling approximately $1.4 million for other-than-temporary impairment of our unrestricted and restricted investments in Gaiam, Inc. common stock due
to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded to adjust our investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value. At September 28, 2003 our unrestricted and restricted shares of Gaiam
Inc. had an adjusted cost basis of approximately $0.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and a fair value of approximately $0.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. At September 28, 2003, an unrealized loss of approximately $0.1 million
related to our unrestricted shares was included as a component of shareholders’ equity.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    To the Board of Directors  Whole Foods Market, Inc.    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“the Company”) as of September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended September 26, 2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Whole Foods Market, Inc. as of September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the
period ended September 26, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.    /s/ Ernst & Young LLP  Austin, Texas  October 28, 2004

  Whole Foods Market, Inc. 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Fiscal years ended September 26, 2004, September
28, 2003 and September 29, 2002    (1) Description of Business
   Whole Foods Market, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively
“Whole Foods Market,” “Company,” or “We”) own and operate the largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to promote vitality and well-being for all individuals by supplying the
highest quality, most wholesome foods available. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last 24
years. We opened our first store in Texas in 1980 and, as of September 26, 2004, have expanded our operations both by opening new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties to 163 stores: 154 stores in 28 U.S. states and the District of
Columbia; two stores in Canada; and seven stores in the United Kingdom.    (2)
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    Definition of Fiscal Year
   We report our results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year
ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 52-week years.    Principles of Consolidation    The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. All significant majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, and
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.    Cash and Cash Equivalents    We consider
all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.    Restricted Cash    Restricted cash
primarily relates to cash held as collateral to support projected workers’ compensation obligations which previously were secured by letters of credit outstanding under our line of credit facility.    Inventories    We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost was determined using the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method for
approximately 94.2% and 96.4% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the LIFO method, the cost assigned to items sold is based on the cost of the most recent items purchased. As a result, the costs of the first items
purchased remain in inventory and are used to value ending inventory. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value, or LIFO reserve, was approximately $11.2 million and $9.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003,
respectively. Costs for the balance of inventories are determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method.    Cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 50% and 56% of inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under the retail method, the
valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are
certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Cost was determined using the item cost method for approximately 50% and 44% of
inventories in fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. This method involves counting each item in inventory, assigning costs to each of these items based on the actual purchase costs (net of vendor allowances) of each item and recording the actual
cost of items sold. The item-cost method of accounting allows for more accurate reporting of periodic inventory balances and enables management to more precisely manage inventory and purchasing levels when compared to the retail method of
accounting.    Our largest supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc., accounted for
approximately 20%, 18% and 14% of our total purchases in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

   Property and Equipment
   Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation
and amortization. We provide depreciation of equipment over the estimated useful lives (generally three to 15 years) using the straight-line method. We provide amortization of leasehold improvements on the straight-line method over the shorter of
the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the related leases. We provide depreciation of buildings over the estimated useful lives (generally 20 to 30 years) using the straight-line method. Costs related to a projected site
determined to be unsatisfactory and general site selection costs that cannot be identified with a specific store location are charged to operations currently. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on significant
projects constructed or developed for the Company’s own use are capitalized as a separate component of the asset. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and any
gain or loss is reflected in earnings.    Investments    We classify as available-for-sale our cash equivalent investments and long-term investments
in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values. Available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale investments are excluded from
earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity until realized. A decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other-than-temporary or for a period greater than two
fiscal quarters results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis of the security is established. Cost basis is established and maintained utilizing the specific identification
method.    Goodwill    Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts
assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, on a reporting unit level. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill
impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose of identifying impairment. Our annual impairment review requires extensive use
of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level, could produce significantly different results.    Intangible Assets    Intangible assets include acquired leasehold rights, license agreements, non-competition agreements and debt issuance costs. All of the
Company’s acquired identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization. Amortization expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, currently one to 26 years for contract-based intangible assets and
one to five years for marketing-related and other identifiable intangible assets.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of    We evaluate long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. When the Company commits to relocate a location, a
charge to write down the related assets to their estimated net recoverable value is included in the “Pre-opening and relocation costs” line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments    The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued payroll, bonuses and team
member benefits, and other accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Investments are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of shareholders’ equity until
realized.    The fair value of notes receivable and convertible subordinated
debentures are estimated using quoted market prices. The fair value of senior unsecured notes is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at the rates currently available to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. Carrying
amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments other than those for which carrying amounts approximate fair values as noted above are as follows (in thousands):

   Insurance and Self-Insurance
Reserves    The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance
plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with
the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the
estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.   
Revenue Recognition    We recognize revenue for sales of our products at the point of sale. Discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold.    Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy Costs    Cost of goods sold includes cost of inventory sold during the period, net of discounts and
allowances, contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation operations, shipping and handling cost and occupancy cost. The Company receives various rebates from third party vendors in the form of quantity discounts and payments under
cooperative advertising agreements. Such rebates are classified as either a reduction to cost of goods sold or a reduction of cost incurred, depending on the nature of the rebate, and are recognized when the related merchandise is sold. 
  Advertising    Advertising and marketing expense for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately $17.4 million, $15.4 million and $11.1 million,
respectively. These amounts are shown net of vendor allowances received for co-operative advertising of approximately $1.0 million, $2.2 million and $2.2 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Advertising costs are charged to
expense as incurred and are included in the “Direct store expenses” line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Effective the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal year 2003, allowances received for co-operative advertising
in excess of identifiable advertising costs are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold when the related merchandise is sold.    Pre-opening and Relocation Costs    Pre-opening costs, which include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new locations, are
expensed as incurred. Relocation costs, which consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment costs, other costs associated with replaced facilities and other related expenses, are expensed as
incurred.

Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   
Income Taxes    We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are adjusted to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date.    Stock-Based Compensation    In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure,” we continue to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB No. 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
interpretations in accounting for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant.    As required by SFAS No. 123 and 148, we have determined pro forma net income and earnings per
common share as if compensation costs had been determined based on the fair value of the options granted to team members and then recognized ratably over the vesting period. The fair value of stock option grants has been estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes multiple option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

   Earnings per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the fiscal period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus, where applicable, the additional common shares that would have been outstanding as a result of the conversion
of dilutive options and convertible debt.    Comprehensive Income
   Comprehensive income consists of net income, foreign currency translation
adjustment and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of income taxes. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income. At September 26, 2004 and September 28,
2003, accumulated other comprehensive 
  
36 


Table of Contents
Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   

income consisted of foreign currency translation adjustment gains of approximately $2.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and unrealized losses on
marketable securities of approximately $0.5 million and $32,000, respectively.    Foreign Currency Translation    The Company’s Canadian and
United Kingdom operations use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange
rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.    Segment Information    We operate in one reportable segment, natural foods supermarkets. We currently have two stores in Canada and seven stores in the United Kingdom. All of our remaining operations are domestic.    Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. We use estimates when accounting for depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, long-term investments, team member benefit plans, team member health insurance plans, workers’ compensation liabilities,
income taxes, reorganization reserves and contingencies.    Reclassifications
   Where appropriate, we have reclassified prior years’ financial
statements to conform to current year presentation.    Recent Accounting
Pronouncements    The EITF issued EITF No. 03-10, “Application of Issue
No. 02-16 by Resellers to Sales Incentives Offered to Consumers by Manufacturers,” in November 2003. EITF Issue No. 03-10 addresses the accounting for manufacturer sales incentives offered directly to consumers, including manufacturer coupons.
EITF Issue No. 03-10 became effective the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 03-10 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.    (3) Property and Equipment    Balances of major classes of property and equipment are as follows (in thousands):

impairments totaling approximately $1.9 million and $1.0 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. Property and equipment includes approximately $2.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.3 million of interest capitalized during
fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Development costs of new store locations totaled approximately $155.2 million, $89.0 million and $100.0 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. As of November 30, 2004, we had signed
leases for 53 stores under development.

(4) Business Combinations    Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited    On January 31, 2004, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild Holdings Limited (“Fresh & Wild”) for a total of approximately $20 million
in cash and approximately $16 million in Company common stock, totaling 238,735 shares. The acquisition of Fresh & Wild, which owned and operated seven natural and organic food stores in London and Bristol, England, provided a platform for
expansion of the Whole Foods Market brand in the United Kingdom. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on
their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $30.5 million have been recorded as goodwill. The Company also agreed to an additional purchase price
consideration contingent on the market price of Company common stock at January 31, 2006. If the market price of Company stock at January 31, 2006 is less than the market price at acquisition of $68.59 per share, those sellers who received and
continuously hold through January 31, 2006 Company common stock are eligible to receive an amount, in stock, cash or any combination thereof, equal to the deficit multiplied by the number of shares continuously held. Fresh & Wild results of
operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period beginning February 1, 2004 through September 26, 2004. John Mackey, our Chief Executive Officer and Walter Robb, our Co-President and Chief Operating Officer each
owned approximately 0.2% of the outstanding stock of Fresh & Wild and received proceeds totaling approximately $54,000 and $78,000, respectively, as consideration for their ownership interest.    Select Fish LLC    On October 27, 2003, we acquired certain assets of Select Fish LLC (“Select Fish”)
in exchange for approximately $3 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. All assets acquired relate to a seafood processing and distribution facility located in Seattle, Washington. This transaction was accounted for using the
purchase method. Accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets
acquired of approximately $1.1 million have been recorded as goodwill. Select Fish results of operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period beginning October 27, 2003 through September 26, 2004.    Harry’s Farmers Markets    On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harry’s Farmers
Markets, Inc. in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets acquired are all assets relating to the three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real
estate, the Harry’s Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and
identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of these
acquired operations are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period beginning October 31, 2001 through September 29, 2002 and all subsequent periods.    (5) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate goodwill to one
reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We acquired goodwill totaling approximately $31.7 million in connection with the acquisition of Select Fish and Fresh and Wild during fiscal year 2004 and $8.7 million in connection with acquisition of
Harry’s Farmers Market during fiscal year 2002. There was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal years 2004, 2003 or 2002.

All of our acquired identifiable intangible assets are amortized over the useful life of the related agreement. We
acquired intangible assets totaling approximately $0.6 million and $6.5 million during fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively, consisting primarily of acquired leasehold rights. Amortization associated with intangible assets totaled approximately
$3.0 million and $2.9 million during fiscal years 2004 and 2003, respectively. The components of intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):

   On October 1, 2004, we amended our
credit facility to extend the maturity of our $100 million revolving line of credit to October 1, 2009. The credit agreement contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain negative covenants
including limitations on additional indebtedness as defined in the agreement. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, we were in compliance with the applicable debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest
at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees of 0.15% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 no amounts were drawn under the agreement.
The amounts available to the Company under the agreement were effectively reduced to $96.5 million and $80.2 million by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $3.5 million and $19.8 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003,
respectively.    We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated
debentures which had a carrying amount of approximately $158.8 million and $151.4 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a principal amount at maturity
on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures have a conversion rate of 10.640
shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, representing approximately 3,280,000 shares. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount totaling
approximately $188 million and $241 million, respectively. No debentures were redeemed at the option of the holder on the potential redemption date of March 2, 2003. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase
price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption.
The Company may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and
future senior indebtedness.    We also have outstanding senior unsecured notes
that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly with a carrying amount of approximately $11.4 million and $17.1 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. Principal on the senior notes is payable in annual installments of
approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006.    (7) Leases 
  The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment and certain
operating leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal clauses at various dates from 2004 to 2040. Rental

expense charged to operations under operating leases for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled approximately $89.0 million, $77.4 million and $66.8
million, respectively. Amortization of equipment under capital lease is included with depreciation expense. Minimum rental commitments required by all non-cancelable leases are approximately as follows (in thousands):

   Minimum rentals for operating leases
do not include certain amounts of contingent rentals that may become due under the provisions of leases for retail space. These agreements provide that minimum rentals may be increased based on a percent of annual sales from the retail space. During
fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, we paid contingent rentals of approximately $4.8 million, $4.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Certain operating leases for facilities provide for scheduled rental increases or rental increases based on
price indices. No asset retirement obligations have been incurred associated with operating leases. Sublease rental income totaled approximately $1.5 million, $1.1 million and $0.9 million during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.
   John P. Mackey and Glenda Flanagan, executive officers of the Company, own
approximately 51% and 2%, respectively, of BookPeople, Inc., a retailer of books and periodicals that is unaffiliated with the Company, which leases retail space in Austin, Texas from the Company. The lease provides for an aggregate annual minimum
rent of approximately $0.4 million which the Company received in rental income in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. The Company expects to assign the rights associated with this lease during fiscal year 2005 in connection with the relocation of its
corporate headquarters.    (8) Income Taxes    Components of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations are as follows (in

   We have provided valuation allowances
of approximately $15.7 million for deferred tax assets associated with international operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be
realized. The valuation allowance increased by approximately $7.1 million in fiscal year 2004 primarily due to current and acquired international loss carryforwards. As of September 26, 2004 we had domestic net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $32 million which will expire in 2020 and international net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $25 million, of which $9 million will expire in 2011 and $16 million have an indefinite life. Management believes that it
is more likely than not that we will fully realize the remaining domestic deferred tax assets in the form of future tax deductions based on the nature of these deductible temporary differences and a history of profitable operations.

(9) Investments    We had short-term cash equivalent investments totaling approximately $184.1 million and $162.0 million at September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, respectively. At
September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, an unrealized loss of approximately $0.4 million and an unrealized gain of approximately $0.1 million, respectively, related to cash equivalent investments was included as a component of shareholders’
equity.    During fiscal year 2004, we sold all of our investments in Gaiam, Inc
for approximately $1.8 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.5 million. Our investments in Gaiam, Inc., a public company, consisted of 80,000 unrestricted common shares, which were classified as available-for-sale securities and 250,000
restricted common shares, for which we accounted using the cost method. During fiscal year 2003 we recognized losses totaling approximately $1.4 million for other-than-temporary impairment of our unrestricted and restricted investments in Gaiam,
Inc. common stock due to a sustained decline in market value of the stock below our carrying value. This impairment charge was recorded to adjust our investments in Gaiam, Inc. to quoted market value. As of September 28, 2003 our unrestricted shares
of Gaiam, Inc. had a carrying value and fair value of approximately $0.5 million and our restricted shares of Gaiam, Inc. had an adjusted cost basis of approximately $1.7 million.    (10) Discontinued Operations    In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the
NatureSmart business was accounted for and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. During fiscal year 2002, we completed the sale of the facility in Thornton, Colorado that was used by NatureSmart for
approximately $15 million in cash. During fiscal year 2003, we completed the sale of an undeveloped property in Westminster, Colorado that was associated with discontinued operations for approximately $3.0 million in cash. At September 26, 2004,
substantially all activities associated with discontinued operations have been completed.    (11) Shareholders’ Equity    Dividends    On November 12, 2003, the Company announced its
first quarterly cash dividend. The first dividend of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.1 million, was paid on January 16, 2004 to shareholders of record as of January 6, 2004. The second divided of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.2 million,
was paid on April 19, 2004 to shareholders of record as of April 9, 2004. The third dividend of $0.15 per share, in the amount of $9.4 million, was paid on July 19, 2004 to shareholders of record as of July 9, 2004, and the fourth dividend of $0.15
per share, in the amount of $9.4 million, was paid on October 18, 2004 to shareholders of record as of October 8, 2004. On November 10, 2004, the Company announced a 27% increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.19 per share. The first $0.19 per
share dividend is payable on January 17, 2005 to shareholders of record as of January 7, 2005.    Treasury Stock    The Board of Directors
has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million in outstanding shares of Company common stock. In fiscal year 2002, we reissued shares from treasury at average cost for certain options exercised. During fiscal year 2002, approximately
342,000 shares were reissued from treasury for a total of approximately $5.4 million. At September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003, we had no shares of Company common stock in treasury.     Preferred Stock Purchase Rights    In October, 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of one-half
Right to purchase preferred stock (“Right”) for each outstanding share of Company common stock, and since that distribution, shares of Company common stock have been issued with accompanying Rights. Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase from the Company a fractional share consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, at a purchase price of $225 per fractional share, subject to adjustment.
The Rights generally will not become exercisable until 10 days after a public announcement that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of Company common stock (thereby becoming an “Acquiring Person”) or the commencement of a tender or
exchange offer that would result in an Acquiring Person. Generally, if any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void), will thereafter
entitle its holder to purchase, at the 
  
42 


Table of Contents
Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)   

Rights’ then current exercise price, shares of our common stock having a market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. If, after there is
an Acquiring Person, and the Company or a majority of its assets is acquired in certain transactions, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person will entitle its holder to purchase, at a discount, shares of common stock of the acquiring entity (or
its parent) in the transaction. After there is an Acquiring Person, the Company’s Board of Directors may, under certain circumstances, exchange shares of our common stock or other securities for each Right not held by an Acquiring Person. At
any time until 10 days after a public announcement that the Rights have been triggered, our Company will generally be entitled to redeem the Rights for $.01 and to amend the Rights in any manner. Certain subsequent amendments are also permitted. The
Rights expire on September 22, 2009.    (12) Earnings per Share
   The computation of basic earnings per share is based on the number of
weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents consisting of common shares deemed outstanding from the assumed exercise of stock
options and the assumed conversion of zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures. A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations follows (in thousands):

(13) Team Member Benefit Plans    Team Member Stock Option Plans    Our Company grants options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended. Under these plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the
market value of the stock at the date of grant and are generally exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from date of grant. Options granted in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 expire seven years from date of grant. Our
Company has, in connection with certain of our business combinations, assumed the stock option plans of the acquired companies. All options outstanding under our Company’s previous plans and plans assumed in business combinations continue to be
governed by the terms and conditions of those grants. At September 26, 2004, September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002, approximately 5.6 million, 2.2 million and 1.3 million shares of our common stock, respectively, were available for future option
grants. The following table summarizes option activity (in thousands, except per share data):

   At September 28, 2003 and September
29, 2002, approximately 2.8 million and 3.1 million outstanding options, respectively, were exercisable. The weighted average exercise price for outstanding exercisable options was $24.85 and $22.32 at September 28, 2003 and September 29, 2002,
respectively. The weighted average estimated fair values at grant date of team member stock options granted during fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $29.37, $22.43 and $20.25, respectively.    Team Member Stock Purchase Plan    Our Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full-time team members with a
minimum of 400 hours of service. Under this plan, participating team members may purchase our common stock each fiscal quarter through payroll deductions. Participants in the stock purchase plan may elect to purchase unrestricted shares at 100
percent of market value or restricted shares at 85 percent of market value on the purchase date. Participants are required to hold restricted shares for two years before selling them. We issued approximately 16,000, 14,000 and 15,000 shares under
this plan in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.    Team Member
401(k) Plan    Our Company offers a team member 401(k) plan to all team
members with a minimum of 1,000 service hours in one year. The Company did not make a matching contribution to the plan in fiscal year 2004. Matching contributions totaling approximately $3.1 million and $4.5 million in fiscal years 2003 and 2002,
respectively, were made in newly issued Company common stock totaling approximately 67,000 shares and 106,000 shares, respectively.

(14) Quarterly Results (unaudited)    The Company’s first quarter consists of 16 weeks, and the second, third and fourth quarters consist of 12 weeks. Because the first
quarter is longer than the remaining quarters, it typically represents a larger share of our annual sales from existing stores. Quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new
store openings. The Company believes that the following information reflects all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily
indicative of results for any future period.    The following tables set forth
selected quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of operations information for the fiscal years ended September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003 (in thousands except per share data):

  (15) Commitments and Contingencies
   The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to
provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks
that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated
accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.    From time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property and other
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.    The Company has entered into Retention Agreements with certain executive officers of the
Company or its subsidiaries which provide for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause after a “Triggering Event.” A Triggering Event includes a merger of the Company with and into an unaffiliated
corporation if the Company is not the surviving corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The benefits to be received by the executive officer whose employment is terminated after a Triggering Event occurs
include receipt of his or her annual salary through the one-year period following the date of the termination of employment and the immediate vesting of any outstanding stock options granted to such executive officer.

We have a policy that limits the cash compensation paid to any officer in the calendar year
to fourteen times the average salary of all full time Team Members. For 2004, this salary cap was approximately $427,000. In the rare instances in which total amounts earned exceed the salary cap, the excess is deferred to the following year;
however, 2004 is the last year in which such deferral is permitted by our policy. Salary and bonus amounts actually received by named officers during the year may be more or less than amounts shown above due to payment of amounts earned and deferred
in prior years, officers electing to take time-off without pay, and deferral of amounts due to salary cap limitations. Total cash compensation amounts actually paid during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, were as follows: Mr. Mackey, $368,000,
$409,000 and $331,000; Ms. Flanagan, $366,000, $406,000 and $191,000; Mr. Gallo, $384,000, $386,000 and $376,000; Mr. Robb, $426,000, $409,000 and $389,000; and Mr. Sud, $380,000, $357,000 and $371,000.   


(2)
Except as otherwise indicated, the amounts reflect our contributions on behalf of the persons
indicated to the Whole Foods Market 401(k) plans.    Retention
Agreements    Since November 1991, the Company has entered into Retention
Agreements with certain executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries which provide for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause after a “Triggering Event.” A Triggering Event includes a
merger of the Company with and into an unaffiliated corporation if the Company is not the surviving corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The benefits to be received by the executive officer whose
employment is terminated after a Triggering Event occurs include receipt of his or her annual salary through the one-year period following the date of the termination of employment and the immediate vesting of any outstanding stock options granted
to such executive officer.
