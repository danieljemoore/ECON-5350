  This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 concerning our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the future. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available operating, financial and competitive information and
are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Please see “Item 1. Business—Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results”
for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our business.    PART I    
Item 1.    Business    General  Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the country’s largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to improve the health, well-being, and healing of both people and the planet. To
achieve this mission, we plan to continue to expand our retail operations to offer the highest quality and most nutritious foods to more and more customers, helping them live healthier and more vital lives. Through our growth, we have had a large
and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last twenty-two years.    We opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and as of September 29, 2002, we operated 135 stores in 25 states plus the District of Columbia and Canada. Our sales have grown rapidly through new
store openings, acquisitions and same store sales growth, from approximately $120 million in fiscal year 1992, excluding the effect of pooling-of-interests transactions completed since 1992, to approximately $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2002, a
compounded annual growth rate of approximately 36%. Our stores currently average approximately 31,000 square feet in size and approximately $21 million in annual sales. Our stores are supported by regional distribution centers, bakehouses,
commissary kitchens, a seafood processing facility, two produce procurement and field inspection offices, and a coffee roasting operation. Our goal is to become a national brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods, but with being the
best food retailer in every community in which we are located.    The Natural Products Industry  According to a leading trade publication for the industry, natural products sales grew to over $34 billion in 2001, a 7% increase over the prior year. The natural and organic products we offer in our
stores include foods and beverages, dietary supplements, personal care products, household goods and educational products. Sales growth for natural and organic foods is being driven by numerous factors, including:   


•
 
healthier eating patterns driven by a better-educated populace whose median age is increasing each year;    


•
 
increasing consumer concern over the purity and safety of food due to the presence of pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and other
chemicals, and genetically engineered ingredients; and    


•
 
environmental concerns due to the degradation of water and soil quality.     Natural foods can be defined as foods which are minimally processed, largely or completely free of artificial ingredients, preservatives and other non-naturally occurring chemicals and as near to their
whole, natural state as possible. Organic products are grown through methods that support and enhance the earth’s natural balance. Organic food products are produced using:   


•
 
agricultural management practices that promote and enhance ecosystem health and use no genetically engineered seeds or crops, sewage sludge, long-lasting
pesticides, herbicides or fungicides;    


•
 
livestock management practices that promote healthy, humanely treated animals by providing organically-grown feed, fresh air and outdoor access while using no
antibiotics or growth hormones; and    


•
 
food processing practices that protect the integrity of the organic product and disallow irradiation, genetically modified organisms (“GMO’s”) or
synthetic preservatives.

  The Organic Rule  The
rapid, consistent growth of the organics industry over the past 20 years created the need for a set of national organic standards to serve as clear guidelines for the industry and its customers as to what can be considered organic. Many individuals
and groups involved in the organic industry (including Whole Foods Market and some of our vendors) worked closely with congressional representatives to help shape what eventually, after 11 years of input and revision, became the United States
Department of Agriculture’s (“USDA”) Organic Rule, implemented into Federal law on October 21, 2002.    Under this new rule,
all products labeled as “organic” in any form must now be certified by a USDA-accredited certifying agency. Furthermore, retailers, including Whole Foods Market, who handle, store, and sell organic products must implement measures to
protect their organic integrity by:   


•
 
preventing the commingling of organic and conventional products;    


•
 
protecting organic products from contact with prohibited substances (such as sanitation and pest control products);    


•
 
labeling organic products properly and clearly; and    


•
 
keeping proper records with regard to organic handling procedures and vendor relationships.     Whole Foods Market has been protecting organic integrity for years, and we are pleased to have the USDA’s new Organic Rule as a guiding standard. We have
created a comprehensive Good Organics program consisting of new merchandising, product storage and handling, and cleaning and sanitation procedures for every team dealing with organic products. All team members are trained on the basics of specific
Good Organics procedures. We monitor our stores to ensure compliance and act diligently to address any concerns.    Business Strategy
  Whole Foods Market is the country’s largest retailer of natural and organic products. We believe that much of our success to date is because we remain
uniquely mission driven. We are highly selective about what we sell, we believe in providing an empowering work environment for our team members, and we are committed to sustainable agriculture.   
Whole Foods  We obtain our products locally and from all over the world, often from small, uniquely dedicated
food artisans. We strive to offer the highest quality, least processed, most flavorful and naturally preserved foods. We believe that food in its purest state – unadulterated by artificial additives, sweeteners, colorings and preservatives
– is the best tasting and most nutritious food available.    Whole People  We recruit the best people we can to become part of our team. We empower them to make many operational decisions, creating a respectful workplace where team members are treated fairly and are highly motivated to succeed. We
look for team members who are passionate about food but who are also well-rounded human beings who can play a critical role in helping to build our stores into profitable and beneficial parts of their communities.    Whole Planet  We believe companies, like individuals, must assume their share of
responsibility for our planet. On a global basis we actively support organic farming, which we believe is the best method for promoting sustainable agriculture and protecting the environment and farm workers. On a local basis, we are actively
involved in our communities by supporting food banks, sponsoring neighborhood events, compensating our team members for community service work, and contributing at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to not-for-profit
organizations.

  Growth Strategy  Whole
Foods Market’s growth strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and acquisitions of existing stores. We have a disciplined, opportunistic real estate and acquisition strategy, opening or acquiring stores in existing
trade areas as well as new markets. Our new stores typically range between 30,000 to 50,000 square feet and are located on premium real estate sites. We have also grown through acquisitions, with approximately 35% of our store base consisting of
acquired stores. As the natural foods retailing industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many smaller local and regional chains, we may continue to pursue acquisitions of smaller chains that provide access to desirable locations and markets as
well as experienced team members. Such acquisitions, however, are expected to have less of an impact on our future store growth and financial results than they have had in the past primarily due to the growing base size of the Company. Our
historical store growth is summarized below:

Stores acquired in pooling transactions are reflected as acquired in the period in which the applicable transaction closed.  
  On April 22, 2002, we announced the signing of a long-term lease for a new 170,000 square foot office building to be developed in conjunction with a
new 80,000 square foot landmark store in Austin. The facility has an estimated completion date of early 2005. Also, on May 1, 2002, we opened our first international store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As of November 29, 2002, we had signed leases
for 19 stores averaging approximately 41,000 square feet in size.    Products  On average, our stores carry approximately 26,000 SKUs of food and non-food products. We have a broad product selection with a heavy emphasis on perishable foods designed to appeal to both natural foods and gourmet shoppers.
Most of our products are from natural food vendors; however, we do sell a limited selection of conventional national brands that meet our quality standards.    Quality Standards  Our business is to sell the highest quality foods we can find at the most competitive prices possible. We evaluate quality in
terms of nutrition, freshness, appearance and taste. Our search for quality is a never-ending process involving the careful judgment of buyers throughout the Company.   


•
 
We carefully evaluate each and every product that we sell.    


•
 
We feature foods that are free from artificial preservatives, colors, flavors and sweeteners.    


•
 
We are passionate about great tasting food and the pleasure of sharing it with each other.    


•
 
We are committed to foods that are fresh, wholesome and safe to eat.    


•
 
We seek out and promote organically grown foods.    


•
 
We provide food and nutritional products that support health and well being.

Table of Contents
  Product Categories  Our
product categories include, but are not limited to: produce, seafood, grocery, meat and poultry, bakery, prepared foods and catering, specialty (beer, wine and cheese), whole body (nutritional supplements, vitamins, body care and educational
products such as books), floral, pet products and household products. Perishable products, defined as food and other products subject to spoilage, accounted for approximately 65% of our total retail sales in fiscal year 2002. We believe our heavy
emphasis on perishable products differentiates us from conventional supermarkets and helps us to attract a broader customer base. We believe that all shoppers, not just natural and organic food shoppers, appreciate great produce, dairy, meat,
seafood, bakery and prepared foods.    Private Label Products  While there are several prominent national brands in the natural products industry, our private label program has comparatively strong brand recognition. We have taken advantage of this opportunity and over the last several years
have expanded our private label offerings, which currently feature over 1,200 SKUs. In fiscal year 2002, we began a major expansion of our private label program with the introduction of our “365 Organic” line. At the close of fiscal year
2002, we offered approximately 30 different 365 Organic products, including organic canola oil, organic salad dressings, organic sodas, and organic apple juice. Our original “365” line of value-oriented products will continue to grow, as
will our ”Whole Kids” line, which will be adding juices, cereals and other new products developed specifically for children. Our private label sales in grocery and nutrition currently account for approximately 14% of our total sales in
those product categories. We also offer specialty and organic coffees and teas through our Allegro Coffee Company subsidiary.    Store
Operations  Team Approach to Store Operations  We promote a strong Company culture featuring a
team approach to store operations that we believe is distinctly more empowering of employees than that of the traditional supermarket. Our stores employ between 73 and 388 team members who are organized into up to eleven teams, each led by a team
leader. Each team is responsible for a different product category or aspect of store operations such as customer service or the front-end which runs the customer checkout stations. Together with our regional framework, we promote a decentralized
team approach to store operations in which many of the personnel, merchandising and operating decisions are made by teams at the individual store level. Because of our management structure, an effective store team leader is critical to the success
of the store. The store team leader works closely with one or more associate store team leaders, as well as with all the department team leaders, to operate the store as efficiently and profitably as possible. Store team leaders are paid a salary
plus an Economic Value Added (“EVA”™) based bonus and are eligible to receive stock
options.    We believe team members are inspired by work that provides them with a greater sense of purpose and mission. For many team
members, their job with us is an extension of their personal philosophy and lifestyle. Many team members feel they are contributing to the good of others by selling clean and nutritious foods, by contributing to long-term sustainable agriculture and
by promoting a pesticide-free and healthier environment. We have a program that provides paid time off to team members for working with qualified community service organizations. For the past five years, Fortune magazine has selected us as one of
the “100 Best Companies to Work for in America.”    We strive to create a Company-wide consciousness of “shared fate”
by uniting the self-interests of team members as closely as possible to the self-interests of our shareholders. One way we reinforce this concept is through a gainsharing program rewarding a team’s labor productivity. We also encourage stock
ownership among team members through the following programs:   


•
 
Team Member Stock Option Plan. Team members are eligible for stock options through seniority, promotion or at the discretion of senior regional or national
leadership.    


•
 
Team Member Stock Purchase Plan. Team members can purchase restricted stock at a discount through payroll deductions.  
 


•
 
Team Member 401(k) Plan. Whole Foods Market stock is an investment option within our Company 401(k) plan.

  Store Description  We do
not have a standard store design model. Instead, each store’s design is customized to fit the size and configuration of the particular location and community in which it is located. We have transformed food shopping from a chore into a dynamic
experience by building and operating stores with colorful décor, well-trained team members, exciting product mixes, teams of in-store chefs, ever-changing selections, samples, open kitchens, scratch bakeries, hand-stacked produce, prepared
foods stations and European-style charcuterie departments. To further a sense of community and interaction with customers, our stores typically include sit-down eating areas, customer comment boards and customer service booths. We have “Take
Action” centers for our customers who want to be informed on important issues relative to environmental, legislative, food safety and product quality issues that can directly affect our customers’ health and well being. In addition, some
stores offer special services such as massage, valet parking and home delivery. Whole Foods Market stores play a unique role as a third place, besides the home and office, where people can gather, interact and learn while at the same time
discovering the many joys of eating and sharing food.    Site Selection  Each of our stores is generally located in a high-traffic shopping area and is either freestanding or in a strip center. In selecting store locations, we use an internally developed model to analyze potential markets based on various
criteria such as education levels, population density and income levels. Approximately 87% of our existing stores are located in the top fifty statistical metropolitan areas. We primarily seek to open large format stores which range in size between
30,000 to 50,000 square feet and are located on premier real estate sites, often in urban, high population locales. After we have selected a target site, our site consultants do a comprehensive site study and sales projection. Potential sites must
pass EVA hurdles. The 19 stores currently under development average approximately 41,000 square feet.     New stores typically open
approximately 12 to 24 months after a store lease is signed. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development
issues. Over the past three years, our new store investment has averaged approximately $8.6 million. This excludes new store inventory of approximately $750,000, a portion of which is financed by our vendors. Pre-opening expenses have averaged
approximately $600,000 per store over the past three years.    Purchasing and Distribution  Our buyers purchase products for retail sale from local, regional and national wholesale suppliers and vendors. Over the last few years, we have shifted the majority of our purchasing operations from
the store to the regional and national level. By purchasing on a regional and national level, we are able to negotiate better volume discounts with major vendors and distributors. We own and operate eight regional distribution centers across the
country. The largest of our regional distribution centers, the Southwest Distribution Center in Austin, Texas, distributes natural products to our stores in Texas, Louisiana, Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico.    Our other regional distribution centers primarily distribute produce and our private label products to our stores in their respective regions. In addition, we
own a seafood wharf, two produce procurement centers, and a specialty coffee roaster and distributor and have established regional commissaries and bakehouses, all of which distribute products to our stores.    Marketing  We spend less on advertising than conventional supermarkets, instead
relying primarily on word-of-mouth recommendations from our customers. We allocate our marketing budget among region-wide programs, our individual stores’ marketing efforts, and a national brand awareness initiative focusing primarily on
national and major market public relations and consumer research. Our stores spend most of their marketing budgets on in-store marketing signs and other materials, store events such as taste fairs, classes, tours and product samplings. To create
goodwill and maintain a high profile within the community, each store also has a separate budget for making contributions to a variety of philanthropic and community activities. We presently contribute at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the
form of cash or products to not-for-profit organizations.    Customer Service  One of our core values as a Company is to satisfy and delight our customers. We want to meet or exceed their expectations on every shopping trip. We know that by doing so we turn customers into advocates for our business.
Advocates do more than shop with us, they talk about Whole Foods Market to their friends and others. We want to serve our customers competently, efficiently, knowledgeably and with flair. We generate greater appreciation and loyalty from our
customers by educating them about natural and organic foods, health, nutrition and the environment through our in-store “Take Action” centers as well as on our corporate web site at www.wholefoodsmarket.com, which features hundreds of
recipes and a library of information about environmental, legislative, food safety and product quality issues.

  Team Members  For the
past five years, our team members have helped Whole Foods Market be selected as one of the Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work for in America.” As of September 29, 2002, we had approximately 24,100 team members, including
approximately 20,400 full-time, 2,500 part-time and 1,200 temporary team members. We are proud that approximately 90% of our permanent team members are full-time team members, which we believe is very high for the food retailing industry. We sponsor
a self-insured health care benefits plan for participating team members. In Texas, we reserve for job-related injury claims as they occur rather than subscribing to a workers’ compensation insurance program for our team members. All of our
full-time and part-time team members are eligible to receive stock options. Our Madison, WI store is the Company’s only store represented by a labor union. A vote to appoint the union as legal representative of this store was certified on
September 7, 2002, and we are currently engaged in collective bargaining negotiations.    Economic Value Added 
We use EVA to evaluate our business decisions and as a basis for determining incentive compensation. In its simplest definition, EVA is equivalent to net operating profits after taxes minus
a charge for the cost of capital necessary to generate that profit. One of our core strengths is our decentralized culture, where decisions are made at the store level, close to the customer. This is one of our strongest competitive advantages, and
we believe that EVA is the framework that team members can use to help make decisions that will create sustainable shareholder value.    We
use EVA extensively for capital investment decisions, including evaluating new store real estate decisions and store remodeling proposals. We are turning down projects that do not add value to the Company in the short- or long-term. The EVA
decision-making model is also enhancing operating decisions in stores. Our emphasis is on EVA improvement, as we want to challenge our teams to continue to innovate and grow EVA in new ways. We believe that opportunities always exist to increase
sales and margins, to lower operating expenses and to make investments that add value in ways that benefit all of our stakeholders. We believe that focusing on EVA improvement encourages continuous improvement of our business. 
  Over 400 leaders throughout the Company are now on EVA-based incentive compensation plans, of which the primary measure is EVA improvement. EVA-based
plans cover our senior executive leadership, regional leadership and the store leadership team in all stores. Incentive compensation for each of these groups is determined based on relevant EVA measures at different levels, including the total
company level, the regional level, the store or facility level, and the team level. We believe using EVA in a multi-dimensional approach best measures the results of decisions made at different levels of the Company. We expect to continue to expand
the use of EVA as a significant component of our compensation structure throughout the Company in the coming years.    The following table
sets forth selected EVA information based on a 10% weighted average cost of capital and a 40% tax rate for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2002, September 30, 2001 and September 24, 2000 (in thousands):

  Competition  Food
retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. Our competitors include local, regional and national conventional and specialty supermarkets, smaller specialty stores and restaurants.   
Natural and organic foods are one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today. Most supermarkets offer at least a limited selection of these products, while some have chosen to
expand their selection more aggressively. We have found it works to our benefit for conventional supermarkets to offer natural and organic products for two reasons. First, it helps fulfill our Company mission of improving the health, well-being and
healing of both people and the planet. Second, it helps create new customers for us by creating a gateway experience. As more people are exposed to the benefits of natural and organic products, they are more likely to become Whole Foods Market
customers as we are the category leader for natural and organic products, offering what we believe is the largest selection and most informed customer service at competitive prices.    Government and Public Affairs  Our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and
administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic beverages.
   The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal
agencies including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”), the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the
Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FFDC Act”). The FFDC Act
has been revised in recent years with respect to dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. We believe we are in material compliance with product labeling requirements.
   Margaret Wittenberg, our Vice President of Governmental and Public Affairs, has served on numerous government boards and industry
committees to create and strengthen the USDA’s Organic Rule (implemented into Federal law on October 21, 2002) and to counsel the USDA and the EPA on pesticide tolerance levels, the use and labeling of GMO’s in the food chain and
preserving marine fisheries.    Trademarks  Trademarks owned
by the Company or its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: “Whole Foods Market,” “Whole Foods Market 365 Everyday Value,” “365 Organic Everyday Value,” “Allegro Coffee Company,” “Bread &
Circus,” “Harry’s Farmers Market,” “Whole Kids” and “Whole Foods, Whole People, Whole Planet.” The Company or its subsidiaries also holds registrations or applications, and maintains common law trademark
rights for stylized logos and brand names for products created by Allegro Coffee Company and many of its private label products.    WholeFoodsMarket.com  Our corporate website at www.wholefoodsmarket.com provides detailed information about our Company and history, product
offerings and store locations, as well as a database of financial and other press releases. It also features hundreds of recipes and a library of information about environmental, legislative, health, food safety and product quality issues. As with

  Our Growth Is Partially Dependent on New Store Openings and Acquisitions  Our strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and, to a lesser extent, acquisitions of existing stores. Successful implementation of this strategy is contingent on numerous
conditions, some of which are described below, and there can be no assurance that our expansion strategy can be successfully executed.    Our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new markets and to operate these stores successfully. Our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable
locations, and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites. We may not be able to timely open new stores or operate them successfully. In addition, we may not be able to successfully hire and train new team members, or integrate
those team members into the programs and policies of our Company. We may not be able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so that we can
operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner.    There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through acquisitions.
For the acquisitions that we do make, we may not be able to successfully integrate those businesses into our operations and support systems, or the operations of acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the introduction of our decentralized
operational approach.    We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Comparable Store Sales  While our comparable store sales increases for the last ten years have averaged 9%, our comparable store sales in the future could fluctuate or be lower than our historical average for many reasons
including new and acquired stores entering into the comparable store base, the opening of new stores in existing markets which cannibalize existing store sales, increased competition, price changes in response to competitive factors, and possible
supply shortages. In addition, we plan to change all of our store brands to Whole Foods Market which may temporarily have a negative impact on our sales. Results of operations may be materially impacted by fluctuations in our comparable store sales
as it becomes more difficult to leverage expenses at a lower level of sales.    We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our
Quarterly Operating Results  Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate for many reasons, including losses from new stores, variations in the mix of product sales,
price changes in response to competitive factors, increases in store operating costs, possible supply shortages and potential uninsured casualty losses or other losses. In addition, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as the
result of the timing of new store openings, the timing of acquisitions, the range of operating results generated from newly opened stores and changes in estimates associated with the disposal of discontinued operations. Quarter to quarter
comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings.    Capital Needed for
Expansion May Not Be Available  The acquisition of existing stores, the opening of new stores and the development of new production and distribution facilities require
significant amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through proceeds from public offerings, bank debt, private placements of debt and internally generated cash flow. These and other sources of capital may not be
available to us in the future. In addition, restrictive covenants that may be imposed by our lenders may restrict our ability to fund our growth.    Increased Competition May Have an Adverse Effect on Profitability  Our competitors currently include other natural foods supermarkets, conventional and
specialty supermarkets, other natural foods stores, small specialty stores and restaurants. These businesses compete with us in one or more product categories. In addition, some traditional and specialty supermarkets are expanding more aggressively
in marketing a range of natural foods, thereby competing directly with us for products, customers and locations. Some of these potential competitors may have been in business longer or may have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and
may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing, promoting and selling their products. Increased competition may have an adverse effect on profitability as the result of lower sales, lower gross profits and/or greater operating costs such as
marketing.    Our Business May be Sensitive to Economic Conditions that Impact Consumer Spending  Our results of operations may be sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions affecting disposable
consumer income such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending to our competitors. A general reduction in the level of discretionary spending or
shifts in consumer discretionary spending to our competitors could adversely affect our growth and profitability.

  Legal Proceedings Could Materially Impact Our Results  From time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the ordinary
course of business. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.    We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People Are Harmed By the Products We Sell  There is increasing
governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. We believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of their interest in health, nutrition and food safety. Although we have intensified our retail food safety
procedures, we believe that our customers hold us to a higher standard than conventional supermarkets. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in product liability claims, the settlement or outcome of which might
have a material adverse effect on our operations.    The Loss of Key Management Could Negatively Affect Our Business 
We are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we were to lose the services of a significant number of key team members within a short period of time, it could
have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member. Our continued success is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs. We
face intense competition for qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing employers. We may not be able to attract and retain team members as necessary to operate our business.    Union Attempts to Organize Our Team Members and Informational Picketing May Disrupt Our Business  Unions may from time to time attempt to organize our team members or portions of our team member base at certain stores or non-retail facilities. Responding to such organization attempts requires substantial management and team
member time and can be disruptive to operations. In addition, our new and existing stores have from time to time been subjected to informational picketing and negative publicity campaigns by members of various local trade unions. These informational
pickets and campaigns may have the effect of lowering the sales volumes of new or existing stores.    Acquired Operations May Experience
Integration Issues  By acquiring new stores in the last several years, we have materially increased the scope of our operations by entering new markets and increasing the
number of stores we operate. There can be no assurance that comparable store sales of acquired stores will increase to or be maintained at the level achieved by our existing stores. Additionally, the operations of acquired stores may be adversely
affected as a result of the introduction of our decentralized team approach to store operations or the response of customers to the changes in operations and merchandising mix that we may make. The integration of acquired operations into our
operations will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily detract attention from our day-to-day business.    Unfavorable Changes in Government Regulation Could Harm Our Business  Our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and
administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic
beverages. Our new store openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses.    The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the
FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the USDA and the EPA. The composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the provisions of the FFDC Act. The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to dietary
supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.    Released by the USDA in
December 2000, with full implementation into law on October 21, 2002, the new Organic Rule facilitates interstate commerce and marketing of fresh and processed food that is organically produced and will provide an assurance to our customers that
such products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with this rule might pose an unbearable burden on some of our suppliers that may cause a disruption in some of our product offerings.

  We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or determine
what effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They could, however, require the reformulation
of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or
scientific substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    Changes in the Availability of Quality Natural and Organic Products Could Impact Our Business  There is no assurance that quality natural and organic
products will be available to meet our future needs. If conventional supermarkets increase their natural and organic product offerings and if new laws require the reformulation of certain products to meet tougher standards, the supply of these
products may be constrained. Any significant disruption in the supply of quality natural and organic products could have a material impact on our overall sales and cost of goods. Our largest supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc., accounted for
approximately 14% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2002.    Our Stock Price Is Volatile  The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events. These market factors include variations in our earnings results,
changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts, publicity regarding us, our competitors, the natural products industry generally, new statutes or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting the
natural products industry specifically, sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur and other factors.    In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market
fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Volatility in the price of our common stock, changes in prevailing interest rates and changes in perception of our creditworthiness may in the future adversely affect the
price of our convertible subordinated debentures.    Information System Upgrades or Integrations May Disrupt Our Operations or Financial
Reporting  We continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, and information systems of
some of the acquired operations have not been fully integrated with our information systems. Although we do not anticipate any disruption in our operations or financial reporting as a result of system upgrades or system integrations, there can be no
assurance that such disruption will not occur or that the desired benefits from the system upgrades will be realized.    We May Not Be
Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights  We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and internal procedures and
nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws
of certain foreign countries in which our products may be produced or sold do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our proprietary information could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Self-Insured Benefits Plan Claims Could Materially
Impact Our Results  We provide self-insured, voluntary team member benefits plans that provide, among other benefits, health care benefits to participating team members. The
plans are designed to provide specified levels of coverage, with excess insurance coverage provided by a commercial insurer. Costs of health care have risen significantly in recent years, and we expect this trend to continue. Although not currently
anticipated by management, our results could be materially impacted by claims and other expenses related to such plans.

Table of Contents
  Investment Losses Could Adversely Impact Our Results  We have investments of approximately $4.4 million in both common and preferred equity securities of Gaiam.com, a non-public Internet company, and a marketable equity investment in Gaiam, Inc., its
parent company. Many factors outside of our control determine whether or not our investments will be successful. Such factors include the ability of an investee to obtain additional financing or to achieve commercial success with its products or
services. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that these investments will maintain their fair value or that we will be able to recover the carrying amount of these investments.    Results of Examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and Other Taxing Authorities Could Materially Impact Our Results  We are subject to periodic audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other state and local taxing authorities. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results could be materially
impacted by the determinations and expenses related to these and other proceedings by the IRS and other state and local taxing authorities.    
Item 2.    Properties    At September 29, 2002, we operated 135 stores in 25 states, the
District of Columbia and Canada. We own store locations in New Orleans, Berkeley and Atlanta. We also own a building in Austin, Texas which houses one of our stores, the corporate headquarters and a bookstore. The underlying property is leased from
a third party under a ground lease which has a remaining base term of approximately 11 years plus ten options to renew for five years each. On November 20, 2001 we completed the sale of the facility in Thornton, Colorado that was associated with
discontinued operations. On December 11, 2002, we completed the sale of an undeveloped property in Westminster, Colorado that was associated with discontinued operations. All other stores, distribution centers, bake houses and administrative
facilities are leased, with expiration dates ranging from one to 38 years. We have options to renew most of our leases with renewal periods ranging from 5 to 50 years. The following table shows the number of our stores by state, the District of
Columbia and Canada as of September 29, 2002:

    The Company had 1,331 record holders of its common stock as of November 29, 2002.
   On June 4, 2001 the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend. All
applicable amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split.    The Company intends to retain any earnings for use in its business and
therefore does not anticipate paying any cash dividend in the foreseeable future. The Company’s present bank credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that include the prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock.

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    General  Whole Foods Market opened its first store in Texas in 1980 and has expanded its operations to 135 stores as of September 29, 2002 both by opening
new stores and acquiring existing stores from third parties. We operate in one reportable segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We currently have one store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All of our remaining operations are domestic. Our
results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation, although some new stores may incur operating
losses for the first one to three years of operations. Our results of operations are reported on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2002 and 2000 are 52-week years and fiscal year 2001 is a 53-week
year.    In November 2000, the Company adopted a plan to dispose of the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of
nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business and related net assets have been recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all years presented. The following discussion and analysis refer only to
continuing operations.    Results of Operations  The
following table sets forth the statements of operations data of Whole Foods Market expressed as a percentage of total sales for the fiscal years indicated:

  Sales  Sales from
continuing operations increased 20.7%, 23.6% and 23.2% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, adjusted to reflect a fifty-two week period in fiscal year 2001. Sales for all years shown reflect increases due to new stores opened and
acquired and comparable store sales increases of approximately 10.0%, 9.2% and 8.6% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty-third full week after the store was opened or
acquired. Identical store sales, which excludes remodels with expansions of square footage greater than 20% and relocations, increased approximately 8.7%, 8.0% and 7.0% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Comparable and identical
store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts, reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular market. These increases are
due to such factors as customers increasing their amount of purchases with us over time, improvements in overall store execution, stronger brand awareness and increased sales of perishables and private label products.    Gross Profit  Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy
costs plus contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation operations. Our gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 34.7%, 34.8% and 34.5% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Gross profit
margin in fiscal year 2002 was negatively impacted by lower margins at the Harry’s Farmers Market stores which were acquired in October 2001. In all years, gross profit margins were positively affected by increased national buying, category
management and private label initiatives, which lower the cost of product purchased on a national basis. Additionally, continued improvement by new stores with respect to product procurement, merchandising and controlling shrink has positively
affected gross profit. In all years, gross profit margins were also positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and increase as stores
mature, reflecting lower shrink as volumes increase, as well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store teams. Gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the increased percentage of sales in certain
regions and in certain departments such as prepared foods where we achieve higher gross profits.    Store Contribution 
Store contribution consists of gross profit less direct store expenses. Store contribution from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 9.6%, 9.5% and 9.4% in fiscal years 2002,
2001 and 2000, respectively. For comparable stores, store contribution from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was 10.4%, 9.6% and 10.1% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. For all stores, direct store expenses from
continuing operations as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.1%, 25.3% and 25.0% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We continue to focus on leveraging of labor and other direct expenses to drive improvement in store
contribution. For all years, higher operating expenses of new stores continue to have a partially offsetting impact on store contribution. Significant increases in health care costs in fiscal year 2002 resulted in increased costs for our self-funded
health insurance plans. We have taken active steps to reform our benefit plans for fiscal year 2003 to better manage our health insurance costs in the future.    General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a percentage of sales were 3.6%, 3.8% and
3.4% in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fiscal year 2002 general and administrative expenses reflect lower amortization expense related to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 and the expiration of certain assets related to non-competition
agreements, which were partially offset by the increased costs of infrastructure for the new South region and increases in other regions and the national office. For fiscal year 2001, general and administrative expenses reflect increases in wage
costs and depreciation from investments in information systems.    Pre-opening and Relocation Costs  Pre-opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings. Pre-opening costs are
incurred primarily in the thirty days prior to a new store or facility opening. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities. We adopted AICPA
Statement of Position (“SOP”) 98-5 “Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities” effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. In accordance with SOP 98-5, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2000 we
reported the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, a one-time charge totaling approximately $375,000 after taxes, representing start-up costs capitalized at September 26, 1999. We developed and opened eleven stores, one bakehouse
and one distribution center in fiscal year 2002, twelve stores in fiscal year 2001 and seventeen stores in fiscal year 2000. Of these, two stores were relocations in both fiscal years 2002 and 2001, and three stores were relocations in fiscal year
2000. Pre-opening and relocation costs were approximately $12.5 million, $8.5 million and $10.5 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Table of Contents
  Store Closure and Asset Disposal Costs  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001, we recognized store closure costs totaling approximately $9.4 million related to the decision to close three locations, all of which were previously acquired in multi-store transactions.
Store closure costs include writedowns of leasehold improvements and store equipment to estimated fair values totaling approximately $5.6 million and estimated lease termination costs and other disposal costs totaling approximately $3.8 million.
Substantially all activities other than lease termination related to these store closures were completed in fiscal year 2002. At September 29, 2002, the terminations of operating leases for the three closed locations remain to be completed.
   Interest Expense  Interest expense consists of costs
related to our convertible subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally developed software. Interest expense, net of amounts capitalized, was
approximately $10.4 million, $17.9 million and $15.1 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Net interest expense for fiscal year 2002 reflects lower average amounts outstanding and lower average interest rates on our $220 million
bank line of credit. As of September 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn on our bank line of credit. Net interest expense for fiscal years 2001 and 2000 reflects additional amounts outstanding on our bank line of credit. Approximately $90.0 million and
approximately $137.0 million was drawn on our bank line of credit at September 30, 2001 and September 24, 2000, respectively.    Investment and Other Income (Loss)  Investment and other income (loss) for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 includes interest, rental and other income
totaling approximately $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. During fiscal year 2000, we determined that our preferred stock investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary.
As a result, we recognized a $10 million pre-tax loss in fiscal year 2000 associated with the writeoff of this investment.    Income
Taxes  Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately 40.0% for fiscal years 2002 and 2001 and approximately 44.6% for fiscal year 2000. Our
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2000 reflects the capital loss associated with the writeoff of our $10 million investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. and a corresponding valuation allowance that was established on the related deferred tax
asset. Excluding the impact of this investment loss, our effective rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2000 was approximately 39.5%. At September 29, 2002, we had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $46
million which will expire in 2020. We consider it more likely than not that all net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized.    Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates  Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year 2001 totaled approximately $5.6 million and
consisted primarily of the writedown of our investment in Gaiam.com to its estimated fair value and our share of Gaiam.com losses. During fiscal year 2001, we determined that our investment in Gaiam.com had suffered a decline in value that was other
than temporary due to lower market valuations of Internet-related companies. As a result, we recognized a loss of approximately $5.5 million to reduce our investment in Gaiam.com to its estimated fair value in fiscal year 2001. No change in the
carrying amount of our investment or share of Gaiam.com losses was required to be recognized in fiscal year 2002. Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year 2000 totaled approximately $14.1 million and consisted primarily of our
share of WholePeople.com Internet operations losses, including WholePeople.com’s investment losses on Internet-related preferred and common stock investments totaling approximately $12.4 million.    Discontinued Operations  In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to
sell the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business has been accounted for and presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal
year 2000, we recorded a loss on disposition of the NatureSmart business totaling approximately $24 million, representing the writedown to estimated net realizable value of the business being discontinued, costs associated with the planned disposal,
and estimated loss from operations of the discontinued business through the expected date of disposition, net of income taxes. In May 2001, we completed the sale of all of our interest in NatureSmart for approximately $28 million in cash. In
November 2001, we completed the sale of the facility in Thornton, Colorado that was used by NatureSmart for approximately $15 million in cash. The gain on disposal of approximately $16.2 million in fiscal year 2001 consists primarily of proceeds
from these sales in excess of the amounts previously estimated and a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued operations, net of taxes. Net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2000 was approximately $9.4
million.

  Business Combinations  On
October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harry’s Farmers Markets, Inc., in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets acquired are all assets relating to the
three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real estate, the Harry’s Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This transaction was accounted for using the
purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible and intangible assets
acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning October 31, 2001 through September 29, 2002.    In February 2000, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Natural Abilities, Inc., which operated three natural foods supermarkets in the Sonoma County,
California area, in exchange for approximately $25.7 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to net assets acquired
based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill totaling approximately $23.9 million. Results of acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning
February 14, 2000 through September 29, 2002.    Quarterly Results  The first quarter consists of 16 weeks, the second and third quarters each consist of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 12 or 13 weeks. Fiscal year 2002 is a 52-week year with the fourth quarter consisting of 12 weeks.
Fiscal year 2001 is a 53-week year with the fourth quarter consisting of 13 weeks. Because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters and contains both the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, it typically represents a larger share of
our annual sales from existing stores. Quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be materially impacted by the timing of new store openings. The historical pattern of quarterly sales and income as a percentage of the
annual total may not be indicative of the pattern in future years. The following tables set forth selected quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of operations information for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001 (in

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We generated cash from operating activities of approximately $229.1 million, $173.0 million and $124.2 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities represented our principal source
of cash and resulted primarily from our net income less non-cash expenses, income tax benefits that resulted from the exercise of team member stock options and changes in operating working capital.    The Company has a $220 million revolving line of credit available through July 14, 2003. This credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including
the prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock. The credit agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this
agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn
and approximately $213.9 million was available under the agreement. At September 30, 2001, approximately $90.0 million was drawn and approximately $126.3 million was available under the agreement. We have outstanding zero coupon convertible
subordinated debentures having a carrying amount of approximately $144.7 million at September 29, 2002. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a principal amount at maturity on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8
million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. Debentures may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2003, March 2, 2008 or
March 2, 2013 for a purchase price equal to issue price plus accrued original issue discount totaling approximately $147 million, $188 million and $241 million, respectively. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this
purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The Company’s long-term revolving bank line of credit expires on July 14, 2003. In the unlikely event a significant redemption occurs on the put date of March 2, 2003
prior to renewal of the long-term line of credit, we intend to settle the debt using common stock. Management has no reason to believe it will not be able to renew the line of credit, but renewal cannot be assured at this time. As a result, if the
convertible debentures are put to the Company, the Company will utilize long-term debt or shares of common stock to settle this obligation. We also have outstanding at September 29, 2002 approximately $22.9 million of senior unsecured notes that
bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly. Principal on the senior notes is payable in annual installments of approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately $29.0 million and $30.2 million in
fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, primarily borrowings on our line of credit, was approximately $77.9 million in fiscal year 2000.    Our principal historical capital requirements have been the funding of the development or acquisition of new stores and acquisition of property and equipment for existing stores. The required cash
investment for new stores varies depending on the size of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord and complexity of site development issues. Over the past three years, our new store investment has averaged
approximately $8.6 million per location. This excludes new store inventory of approximately $750,000, a portion of which is financed by our vendors. As of November 29, 2002, we had signed leases for 19 stores averaging approximately 41,000 square
feet in size. We will incur additional capital expenditures in fiscal year 2003 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades and resets at existing stores and continued development of management information systems. Net cash used in investing
activities was approximately $203.3 million, $156.9 million and $180.7 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Absent any significant cash acquisitions or change in status of our outstanding zero coupon convertible bond issue
which has a put date of March 2, 2003, we do not expect any borrowings on our bank line of credit during fiscal year 2003. We expect that planned expansion and other anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by
cash generated from operations. We continually evaluate the need to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered appropriate based upon the Company’s needs and market conditions.    Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of our financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the continued
appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances.

Table of Contents
  We have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our
operating results and financial position, and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the following accounting
policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.    Insurance and Self-Insurance Reserves  The Company uses a combination of insurance
and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits.
Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions
are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.    Inventory Valuation  We value our inventories, both retail and wholesale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
principally determined by the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. LIFO cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 55% of inventories in both fiscal years 2002 and 2001 and was determined using the item cost method for
approximately 42% and 43% of inventories in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2001, respectively. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value was approximately $7.1 million and $8.0 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30,
2001, respectively. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories.
Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Costs for the balance of
inventories, consisting of the manufactured inventories of Allegro Coffee Company, are determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. We believe we have the appropriate inventory valuation controls in place to minimize the risk
that inventory values would be materially misstated.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” in
June 2001. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.    The FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,” in August 2001. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and other related accounting guidance. SFAS No. 144 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The provisions of this Statement generally are to be applied prospectively. The
provisions of SFAS No. 144 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    The FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections,” in May
2002. The statement rescinds FASB No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,” and an amendment of that statement, FASB No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.” As a result,
gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be aggregated and classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax effect, on the statement of earnings. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15,
2002, with earlier application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. The adoption of SFAS No. 145 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Table of Contents
  The FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities”, in July 2002. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal
plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 146 on our consolidated financial statements.    Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements  Except for the historical information
contained herein, the matters discussed in this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the timely development and opening of new stores, the integration
of acquired stores, the impact of competition and changes in government regulation. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, please see “Item 1. Business—Additional Factors That May Affect
Future Results.” The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.    
Item 7(a).    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    We are exposed to
interest rate changes and changes in market values of our investments and long-term debt. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. The impact of foreign exchange
fluctuations on our foreign subsidiary is not material.    Interest Rate Risk  We are exposed to cash flow and fair value risk from changes in interest rates, which may affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations,
we attempt to manage our exposures through ongoing evaluation of the composition of our long-term debt. Our line-of-credit borrowings do not give rise to significant fair value risk because these borrowings have revolving maturities of less than
three months. At September 29, 2002 no amounts were drawn under our line of credit agreement. At September 30, 2001, approximately $90 million was outstanding under our line of credit agreement at an average interest rate of approximately 4.63%. Our
senior unsecured notes have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and have an outstanding balance of $22.9
million and $28.6 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. At September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $2.1 million and $1.8
million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the senior notes would decrease or increase accordingly.    Interest Rate and Market Risk  Our subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair value of these instruments is affected by
both changes in the market price of our stock and changes in market interest rates. The zero coupon subordinated convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and an outstanding balance of approximately $144.7 million and $137.6
million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. At September 29, 2002 the estimated fair value of the convertible debentures exceeded the carrying amount by approximately $18.2 million. At September 30, 2001, the carrying amount
of the convertible debentures exceeded the estimated fair value by approximately $0.6 million. Should interest rates or the market value of our stock increase or decrease, the estimated fair value of the zero coupon subordinated debentures would
decrease or increase accordingly.    Market Risk  We have
investments in both common and preferred equity securities of Gaiam.com, a non-public Internet company. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. For these investments, our policy is to regularly review the assumptions underlying
the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the carrying values. During fiscal year 2001, we determined that these investments had suffered declines in value that were other than temporary due to lower market valuations of
Internet-related companies. As a result, we recognized losses totaling approximately $5.5 million to reduce our investments in Gaiam.com to their estimated fair values of approximately $3.5 million. The marketable equity investment in Gaiam, Inc.
has a cost basis of approximately of $1.2 million and a fair value of approximately $920,000 and $1.2 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively. At September 29, 2002 an unrealized loss of approximately $280,000 on the
Gaiam, Inc. investment is included as a component of shareholders’ equity. Gaiam, Inc. common stock is traded on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol GAIA.

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  Fiscal years ended September 29, 2002, September 30, 2001 and September 24, 2000    (1)  Company  Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the
country’s largest chain of natural and organic foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to improve the health, well-being, and healing of both people and of the planet. To achieve this mission, we plan to continue to expand our retail
operations to offer the highest quality and most nutritious foods to more and more customers, helping them to live healthier and more vital lives. Through our growth, we have had a large and positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement
throughout the United States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last twenty-two years. We opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and as of September 29, 2002, we operated 135 stores in 25 states, the District of
Columbia and Canada.    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Whole Foods Market, Inc. and its subsidiaries
(“Company”). All significant majority-owned subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.    (2)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  Definition of Fiscal
Year  We report our results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2002 and 2000 are 52-week years and fiscal
year 2001 is a 53-week year.    Cash and Cash Equivalents  For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.   
Inventories  We value our inventories, both retail and wholesale, at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
principally determined by the last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. LIFO cost was determined using the retail method for approximately 55% of inventories in both fiscal years 2002 and 2001 and was determined using the item cost method for
approximately 42% and 43% of inventories in fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2001, respectively. The excess of estimated current costs over LIFO carrying value was approximately $7.1 million and $8.0 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30,
2001, respectively. Under the retail inventory method, the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio for various groupings of similar items to the retail value of inventories.
Inherent in the retail inventory method calculations are certain management judgments and estimates, including shrinkage, which could impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins. Costs for the balance of
inventories, consisting of the manufactured inventories of Allegro Coffee Company, are determined by the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method. Our largest supplier, United Natural Foods, Inc., accounted for approximately 14% of our total
purchases in fiscal year 2002. Balances of inventories are as follows (in thousands):

    Property and Equipment  Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We provide depreciation of equipment over the estimated useful lives (generally 3 to 15 years) using the straight-line method. We provide
amortization of leasehold improvements on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the related leases. We provide depreciation of buildings over the estimated useful lives (generally
20 to 30 years) using the straight-line method. Costs related to a projected site determined to be unsatisfactory and general site selection costs that cannot be identified with a specific store location are charged to operations currently. We
capitalize eligible internal-use software development costs incurred subsequent to the completion of the preliminary project stage. Development costs are amortized over the shorter of the expected useful life of the software or five years.

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    Investments  We account for investments in affiliated entities in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, of an investee (generally an ownership interest of the voting stock of
between 20% and 50%) using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our share of the investee’s earnings or loss is included on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in “Equity in losses of unconsolidated
affiliates.” Our investments in equity-method investees are included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in “Long-term investments.” The portion of our investment in an equity-method investee that exceeds our share of the
net assets of the investee, if any, is included in “ Long-term investments” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.    We classify as available-for-sale our investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and are not accounted for under the equity method and our investments in debt securities. Available-for-sale securities
are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders’ equity until realized. A
decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale security below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary or for a period greater than two fiscal quarters results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to
earnings and a new cost basis of the security is established.    We account for all other investments under the cost method of accounting.
   Goodwill  Goodwill consists of the excess of cost of
acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise, on a
reporting unit level. We allocate goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. We determine fair value utilizing both a market value method and discounted projected future cash flows compared to our carrying value for the purpose
of identifying impairment. Our annual impairment review requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates. Application of alternative assumptions and definitions, such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different
organizational level, could produce significantly different results. Prior to fiscal year 2002 goodwill was amortized over 20 to 40 years using the straight-line method.    Intangible Assets  Intangible assets include acquired leasehold rights, license agreements, non-competition agreements and
debt issuance costs. All of the Company’s acquired identifiable intangible assets are subject to amortization. Amortization expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of the related agreement, currently one to twenty-six years
for contract-based intangible assets and one to five years for marketing-related and other identifiable intangible assets.    Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of  We evaluate long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at
the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued payroll, bonuses and team member benefits, and other accrued expenses approximate fair
value because of the short maturity of those instruments. Marketable securities are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of shareholders’ equity until realized.

    Insurance and Self-Insurance Reserves  The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and
officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors,
severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and
historical trends.    Revenue Recognition  We recognize
revenue for sales of our products at the point of sale.    Pre-opening and Relocation Costs  Pre-opening costs, which include costs associated with hiring and training personnel, supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new locations, are expensed as incurred. We
adopted SOP 98-5 “Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities” effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. In accordance with SOP 98-5, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2000 we reported the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle, a one-time charge totaling approximately $375,000 after taxes, representing start-up costs capitalized at September 26, 1999. The adoption of SOP 98-5 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated depreciation costs, asset impairment costs, other costs associated with replaced facilities and other related expenses.    Advertising  We charge advertising costs to expense as incurred. Advertising and
marketing expense related to continuing operations for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately $11.1 million, $12.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively.    Income Taxes  We recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the
balance sheet date to differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in continuing operations to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in the period that includes the enactment date.    Stock-Based Compensation  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” we continue to apply Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB No. 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and related
interpretations in accounting for our stock option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense relative to our team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant.

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    Earnings (Loss) per Share  Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the fiscal period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding plus, where applicable, the additional common shares that would have been outstanding as a result of the conversion of dilutive options and convertible debt.   
Comprehensive Income (Loss)  Comprehensive income (loss) consists of net income, foreign currency translation
adjustment and unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities, net of income taxes. Comprehensive income (loss) is reflected in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income. At September 29, 2002,
accumulated other comprehensive loss consisted of foreign currency translation adjustment losses of approximately $142,000 and unrealized losses on marketable securities of approximately $280,000.    Foreign Currency Translation  The Company’s international operations use
their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year.
Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.    Segment Information
 We operate in one reportable segment, natural foods supermarkets. We currently have one store in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All of our remaining operations are domestic.
   Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We use estimates when accounting for depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, long-term investments,
team member benefit plans, team member health insurance plans, income taxes, reorganization reserves, disposal of discontinued operations and contingencies.    Reclassifications  Where appropriate, we have reclassified prior years’ financial statements to conform to current year presentation.
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements  The Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,” in June 2001. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, with early application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 143 will be effective
for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 143 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    The FASB issued SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” in August 2001. SFAS No. 144 supersedes SFAS No. 121, “Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of” and other related accounting guidance. SFAS No. 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early application encouraged. The provisions of this Statement generally are to be applied prospectively. The provisions of SFAS No. 144 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002. We do not expect
the adoption of SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 34 


Table of Contents
  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    The FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB
Statements No. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections,” in May 2002. The statement rescinds FASB No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,” and an amendment of that statement,
FASB No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.” As a result, gains and losses from extinguishment of debt will no longer be aggregated and classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax
effect, on the statement of earnings. SFAS No. 145 is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. The provisions of SFAS No. 145 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning September 30, 2002.
The adoption of SFAS No. 145 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.    The FASB issued SFAS No. 146,
“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”, in July 2002. SFAS 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred rather
than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We are evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 146 on our consolidated financial
statements.    (3)  Property and Equipment  Balances of major classes of property and equipment are as follows (in thousands):

2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.    (4) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. SFAS No. 142 provides
that separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment annually, or more
frequently if impairment indicators arise. We allocate our goodwill to one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing. There was no impairment of goodwill during fiscal year 2002. We acquired goodwill totaling approximately $8.7 million in
connection with the Harry’s Farmers Market acquisition during fiscal year 2002.

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    On March 1, 2001, we amended our bank credit agreement to
increase our revolving line of credit to $220 million through June 28, 2003. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2002 we extended the agreement to July 14, 2003. This credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including the
prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock. The credit agreement also contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. At September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, we
were in compliance with the debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate or the LIBOR rate plus a premium. Commitment fees ranging from 0.20% to 0.30% of the undrawn
amount are payable under this agreement. At September 29, 2002, no amounts were drawn and at September 30, 2001, approximately $90 million was drawn under the agreement. The amounts available to the Company under this line of credit were effectively
reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $6.1 million and $3.7 million at September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, respectively.    We have outstanding zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures having a carrying amount of approximately $144.7 million at September 29, 2002. The debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5 percent and a
principal amount at maturity on March 2, 2018 of approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures have a
conversion rate of 10.640 shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, initially representing a conversion price of approximately $35 per share of common stock, or approximately 3,286,000 shares. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of
the holder on March 2, 2003, March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price plus accrued original discount totaling approximately $147 million, $188 million and $241 million, respectively. Subject to certain limitations, at our option, we may
elect to pay this purchase price in cash, shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at the issue price plus accrued original discount to
the date of redemption. Subsequent to March 2, 2003, at our option, we may redeem the debentures for cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures
are subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness.    We also have outstanding approximately $22.9
million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly. Principal on the senior notes is payable in annual installments of approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006. The notes contain certain affirmative and negative
covenants, including maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. At September 29, 2002 and September 30, 2001, we were in compliance with the debt covenants.   
(6) Leases  The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment and certain operating
leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These leases expire or become subject to renewal at various dates from 2003 to 2040. Rental expense charged to operations under operating leases for fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 totaled
approximately $66.8 million, $57.3 million and $47.1 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments required by all noncancelable leases are approximately as follows (in thousands):

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    Minimum rentals for operating leases do not include
certain amounts of contingent rentals that may become due under the provisions of leases for retail space. These agreements provide that minimum rentals may be increased based on a percent of annual sales from the retail space. During fiscal years
2002, 2001 and 2000, we paid contingent rentals of approximately $3.7 million, $2.7 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Certain operating leases for facilities provide for scheduled rental increases or rental increases based on price indices.
Sublease rental income totaled approximately $0.9 million, $0.4 million and $0.4 million during fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Certain officers of the Company own approximately 13% of a business that leases facilities from the

    We have provided a valuation allowance of approximately $8.6 million for deferred tax
assets associated with capital loss carryforwards for which management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $0.3 million in fiscal year 2002
primarily due to the utilization of capital losses. Management believes that it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the remaining deferred tax assets in the form of future tax deductions based on the nature of these deductible
temporary differences and a history of profitable operations. As of September 29, 2002, we had tax net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $46 million which will expire in 2020.   
(8) Business Combinations  Harry’s Farmers Markets  On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Harry’s Farmers Markets, Inc., in exchange for approximately $36 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. The assets acquired are
all assets relating to the three perishables superstores in Atlanta, Georgia, including but not limited to real estate, the Harry’s Farmers Market trade name, distribution center and other support and office facilities. This transaction was
accounted for using the purchase method. Accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Total costs in excess of tangible
and intangible assets acquired of approximately $8.7 million have been recorded as goodwill. Results of acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning October 31, 2001 through September 29, 2002.

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    Natural Abilities  In February 2000, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Natural Abilities, Inc., which operated three natural foods supermarkets in the Sonoma County, California area, in exchange for
approximately $25.7 million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities. This transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated fair
values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill totaling approximately $23.9 million. Results of acquired operations are included in our consolidated income statements for the period beginning February 14, 2000 through
September 29, 2002    (9)  Investments in Internet-related Operations  Effective January 14, 2000, we contributed our Amrion, Inc. and WholeFoods.com, Inc. subsidiaries to WholePeople.com, Inc., in exchange for 14,530,000 shares of convertible preferred stock of
WholePeople.com. Net assets of the contributed subsidiaries totaled approximately $46.1 million. Concurrent with the preferred stock issuance, WholePeople.com issued 3,125,732 shares of Class A common stock of WholePeople.com to unaffiliated
investors (the “Investors”) at $6.3985 per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million. WholePeople.com issued an additional 968,977 shares of Class A common stock to the investors at $6.3985 per share, representing an
aggregate purchase price of $6.2 million. Together with the initial investment of $20.0 million and subsequent Class A common stock issuance of $5.0 million during the third quarter to the Investors, the Investors’ total investment was $31.2
million for 4,876,142 shares of Class A common stock.    Effective June 30, 2000, WholePeople.com restructured its Internet operations by
merging its Internet business into a subsidiary of Gaiam, Inc., a newly formed company named Gaiam.com, Inc. WholePeople.com received a 49.9% interest in the common stock of Gaiam.com. Pursuant to the restructuring, the WholePeople.com web site was
replaced by the Gaiam.com web site. WholePeople.com recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $24.3 million, which consisted of the write-off of its Internet web site, expenses associated with the transfer of Internet operations to
Gaiam.com and severance costs. The remaining business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements formerly known as Amrion was renamed NatureSmart. In addition to these restructuring charges, in fiscal year 2000 WholePeople.com
incurred other pre-tax operating losses from Internet operations totaling approximately $9.5 million. WholePeople.com also recognized pre-tax investment losses on Internet-related preferred stock and common stock investments totaling approximately
$12.4 million. In a separate transaction in June 2000, WholePeople.com purchased from Gaiam the outstanding preferred shares of Gaiam.com for $6.0 million. These shares are redeemable at their face amount upon the occurrence of an initial public
offering of Gaiam.com.    We accounted for our investment in WholePeople.com Internet operations using the equity method. In applying the
equity method, losses were allocated to the stock classes in accordance with the terms of the common and preferred stockholders’ agreements. Accordingly, effective January 14, 2000, the Internet operating results of WholePeople.com were not
reflected in our consolidated results of operations as long as positive common stock equity was available in WholePeople.com. Equity in losses in unconsolidated affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements includes after-tax
losses totaling approximately $14.1 million incurred in WholePeople.com Internet operations after common equity had been reduced to zero. We subsequently exchanged a 15% interest in the common stock of Gaiam.com and a 20% interest in the preferred
shares of Gaiam.com to acquire the remaining common stock of WholePeople.com. As a result, we obtained deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaling approximately $19.2 million and $7.2 million,
respectively. The Company assumed ownership of the Gaiam.com preferred and common equity investments upon adoption of the plan to sell NatureSmart.    We have accounted for our investment in Gaiam.com common stock using the equity method and have recognized losses of Gaiam.com in proportion to our ownership percentage. During fiscal year 2001, we determined that our investment in
Internet-related operations had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary due to lower market valuations of such companies. As a result, we recognized a loss of approximately $5.5 million to reduce our investment in Gaiam.com to its
estimated fair value of approximately $3.5 million as of September 30, 2001. This loss is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in “Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates.”

Table of Contents
  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    During fiscal year 2000, we determined that our preferred
stock investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. had suffered a decline in value that was other than temporary. As a result, we recognized a $10 million pre-tax loss in fiscal year 2000 associated with the writeoff of this investment. This loss is
included in “Investment and Other Income (Loss)” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.    (10)  Discontinued Operations  In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the NatureSmart business of manufacturing and direct
marketing of nutritional supplements. The NatureSmart business has been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The loss on disposition of the
NatureSmart business reported at September 24, 2000 included the writedown to estimated net realizable value of the business being discontinued, costs associated with the planned disposal and the estimated loss from operations of the discontinued
business through the expected date of disposition, net of taxes.    In May 2001, we completed the sale of all of our interest in
NatureSmart for approximately $28 million in cash. In November 2001 we completed the sale of the facility in Thornton, Colorado that was used by NatureSmart for approximately $15 million in cash. The gain on disposal in fiscal year 2001 consists
primarily of proceeds from these sales in excess of amounts previously estimated and a reduction in the estimated future liabilities of the discontinued operations, net of taxes. On December 11, 2002, we completed the sale of an undeveloped property
in Westminster, Colorado that was associated with discontinued operations.    The assets and liabilities related to discontinued
operations, which have been reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets, are summarized as follows (in thousands):

  Whole Foods Market, Inc.  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)    (11)  Store Closure Costs 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 we recognized store closure costs totaling approximately $9.4 million associated with the decision to close three stores, all of which were
previously acquired in multi-store transactions. Store closure costs include writedowns of leasehold improvements and store equipment to estimated fair values totaling approximately $5.6 million and estimated lease termination costs and other
disposal costs totaling approximately $3.8 million. During fiscal year 2001, these three stores generated combined sales totaling approximately $10.5 million and combined negative cash flows totaling approximately $1.0 million. At September 29,
2002, the terminations of operating leases for the three closed locations remain to be completed, with remaining occupancy reserves totaling approximately $3.0 million. We have completed substantially all other activities related to these store
closures in fiscal year 2002, including the retirement of approximately $5.6 million of leasehold improvements and store equipment.    (12)  Shareholders’ Equity  Treasury Stock  The Board of
Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million in outstanding shares of Company common stock. During fiscal year 2000, we repurchased 858,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $13.5 million. In
fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, we reissued shares from treasury at average cost for certain options exercised. During fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, approximately 342,000 shares, 1,170,000 shares and 562,000 shares, respectively, were reissued
from treasury for a total of approximately $5.4 million, $18.3 million and $8.8 million, respectively. At September 29, 2002, we had no shares of Company common stock in treasury.    
Preferred Stock Purchase Rights  On September 22, 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a
dividend of one-half Right to purchase preferred stock (“Right”) for each outstanding share of Company common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on October 4, 1999. Each Right initially entitles the registered holder
to purchase from the Company a fractional share consisting of one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, at a purchase price of $225 per fractional share, subject to adjustment. The
Rights generally will not become exercisable until ten days after a public announcement that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of Company common stock (thereby becoming an “Acquiring Person”) or the commencement of a tender or
exchange offer that would result in an Acquiring Person (the earlier of such dates being called the “Distribution Date”). Rights will be issued with all shares of Company common stock issued from the record date to the Distribution Date.
Until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by the certificates representing Company common stock and will be transferable only with our common stock. Generally, if any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each right, other
than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will thereupon become void), will thereafter entitle its holder to purchase, at the Rights’ then current exercise price, shares of our common stock having a market value of two times
the exercise price of the Right. If, after there is an Acquiring Person, and the Company or a majority of its assets is acquired in certain transactions, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person will entitle its holder to purchase, at a discount,
shares of common stock of the acquiring entity (or its parent) in the transaction. After there is an Acquiring Person, the Company’s Board of Directors may, under certain circumstances, exchange shares of our common stock or other securities
for each Right not held by an Acquiring Person. At any time until ten days after a public announcement that the Rights have been triggered, our Company will generally be entitled to redeem the Rights for $.01 and to amend the rights in any manner.
Certain subsequent amendments are also permitted. The Rights expire on September 22, 2009.

common stock at the end of fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, because to do so would be antidilutive.    (14)  Team Member Benefit Plans  Team Member Stock Option Plans  Our Company grants options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plans, as amended. Under these plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant and are
generally exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from date of grant. Options granted in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000 expire seven years from date of grant. Our Company has, in connection with certain of our business
combinations, assumed the stock option plans of the acquired companies. All options outstanding under our Company’s previous plans and plans assumed in business combinations continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of those grants.
At September 29, 2002, September 30, 2001 and September 24, 2000 approximately 1.3 million, 0.7 million and 0.6 million shares of our common stock, respectively, were available for option grants.

    The Company follows Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” and related interpretations in accounting for stock option grants. As required by SFAS No. 123, we have determined pro forma net income and net income per common share as if compensation costs had been determined based on
the fair value of the options granted to team members and then recognized ratably over the vesting period.

    Team Member Stock Purchase Plan  Our Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full-time team members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Under this plan, participating team members may purchase our common stock each fiscal quarter through
payroll deductions. Participants in the stock purchase plan may elect to purchase unrestricted shares at 100 percent of market value or restricted shares at 85 percent of market value on the purchase date. Participants are required to hold
restricted shares for two years before selling them. We issued approximately 15,000, 21,000 and 24,000 shares under this plan in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.    Team Member 401(k) Plan  Our Company offers a team member 401(k) plan to all team members with a minimum of 1,000 service
hours in one year. Matching contributions totaled approximately $4.5 million, $1.4 million and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Matching contributions in fiscal year 2002 were made in newly issued Company common stock
totaling approximately 106,000 shares. Matching contributions in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 were made in Company common stock purchased in open market transactions totaling approximately 67,000 shares and 28,000 shares, respectively. 
  (15)  Commitments and Contingencies  The Company uses a
combination of insurance and self-insurance plans to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance, vehicle liability and employee health
care benefits. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. While we believe that
our assumptions are appropriate, the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.   
From time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property and other proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Although not currently anticipated by management, our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and expenses related to pending or future proceedings.

Item 13.    Certain Relationships and Related Transactions  Whole Foods Market and Gaiam, Inc. own approximately 35% and 50%,
respectively, of the outstanding common stock of Gaiam.com. Jirka Rysavy, Gaiam’s chairman and majority stockholder, was elected to our Board of Directors in June of 2000 and remained a Director until March 2002. Mr. Mackey served on the Gaiam,
Inc. board of directors from June of 2000 until May 2002. Mr. Mackey and Dr. Elstrott served on the Gaiam.com board of directors from June 2000 until March 2002. The Company does not exercise control over Gaiam.com and therefore has accounted for
its investment in Gaiam.com common stock using the equity method. As of September 29, 2002, the Company’s minority investment in Gaiam.com was approximately $3.5 million. At September 29, 2002, the Company also has a marketable equity
investment in Gaiam, Inc. stock totaling approximately $0.9 million.    John Mackey and Glenda Flanagan, executive officers of the Company,
own approximately 13% in the aggregate of BookPeople, Inc. a retailer of books and periodicals that is unaffiliated with the Company, which leases facilities from the Company. The lease provides for an aggregate annual minimum rent of approximately
$391,000 which we received in rental income in fiscal year 2002.

  During fiscal year 2002, Jim Sud, an executive officer of the Company, was indebted to the Company
pursuant to a loan in the principal amount of $292,000. Mr. Sud repaid the loan in full, together with interest thereon at an annual rate of approximately 6%, in December 2002.    Retention Agreements  Since November 1991, the Company has entered into Retention Agreements with certain executive
officers of the Company or its subsidiaries which provide for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause after a “Triggering Event.” A Triggering Event includes a merger of the Company with and into
an unaffiliated corporation if the Company is not the surviving corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The benefits to be received by the executive officer whose employment is terminated after a Triggering
Event occurs include receipt of his or her annual salary through the one-year period following the date of the termination of employment and the immediate vesting of any outstanding stock options granted to such executive officer. 
  
Item 14.    Controls and Procedures    The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company recognizes that any controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
