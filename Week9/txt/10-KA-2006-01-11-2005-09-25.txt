EXPLANATORY NOTE   On December 8, 2005, we filed the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Whole Foods Market, Inc. (the “Company”) for the fiscal year
ended September 25, 2005. The information required by Part III of such report was not set forth therein and was to be incorporated by reference from the Company’s Definitive Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held
on March 6, 2006. This Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A is being filed solely to include the information that was previously intended to have been so incorporated by reference. As a result, this Amendment No. 1 to
the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A may contain forward-looking information which has not been updated for events subsequent to the date of the original filing, and all information contained in this Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form
10-K/A and the original Annual Report on Form 10-K is subject to updating and supplementing as provided in the periodic reports that the Company has filed or will file with the SEC after the original filing date.    We completed a two for one stock split of our common stock on December 27, 2005.
However, none of the share or per share information set forth in this Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A has been restated to give effect to such stock split, as the original filing (to which this amendment relates) predated
the effectiveness of the stock split.

 Salary amounts shown above reflect the annual rate of pay for the officer and the calendar year shown; salary amounts actually received by named officers may be
less than amounts shown due to officers electing to take time-off without pay. Bonus amounts shown above reflect the sum of the bonus earned for the fiscal year shown less any amounts which would cause cash compensation to exceed the salary cap.
Additionally, certain bonuses shown include amounts earned and deferred in a prior year due to salary cap limitations; however, the Company has changed its policy regarding such deferrals and they will not be permitted in the future. Total salary
and bonus amounts actually paid during 2005, 2004 
  
4 



and 2003, respectively, were approximately as follows: Mr. Mackey, $436,000, $368,000 and $409,000; Ms. Chamberlain, $381,000, $366,000 and
$406,000; Mr. Gallo, $436,000 $384,000 and $386,000; Mr. Robb, $436,000, $426,000 and $409,000; Mr. Sud, $436,000, $380,000 and $357,000; and Mr. Valkenaar $402,000, $426,000 and $357,000. 


(2)
Amount shown reflects a Board approved cash payment related to a prior stock option grant which expired unexercised due to a Company error.    Salary Cap Policy    We have a policy that limits the cash compensation paid to any Team Member in each calendar year, as follows:    A compensation cap is calculated each year by reference to a particular multiple of the
average cash compensation of all full-time Team Members employed during such year. For its fiscal year 2005, the Company continues to use 14 times the above described average.    Employee benefits, stock options and any other form of non-cash compensation, such as 401(k) match, are not counted in determining and
applying the salary cap.    Payouts under our EVA Incentive Compensation Plan
(the “EVA Plan”) fall within the scope of the Company’s salary cap policy. Per our EVA Plan, amounts are contributed annually to a “pool” for each Team Member based on EVA results. A portion of the annual EVA pool
contribution may remain in the pool and a portion is paid out annually. Annual payouts are calculated as 100% of the pool up to certain job specific dollar amounts plus a portion of the excess. If the EVA bonus to be paid out will cause
the Team Member’s cash compensation to exceed the annual salary cap, the amount above the cap is forfeited. However, the full amount which would otherwise be paid out (including amounts not actually paid to the Team Member) is still
subtracted from the pool balance.   The accumulated balance in any Team
Member’s pool account is limited to the amount of the salary cap.    Team
Members may take time off without pay in order to reduce their salary earned and increase the amount of bonus that can be paid within the cap.    The salary cap does not apply in the Team Member’s year of termination or retirement.    The following is the salary cap calculation for the Company’s past 7 fiscal years:

   Retention Agreements
   Since November 1991, the Company has entered into Retention Agreements
with certain executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries which provide for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment other than for cause after a “Triggering Event.” A Triggering Event includes a merger of
the Company with and into an unaffiliated corporation if the Company is not the surviving corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The benefits to be received by the executive officer whose employment is
terminated after a Triggering Event occurs include receipt of his or her annual salary through the one-year period following the date of the termination of employment and the immediate vesting of any outstanding stock options granted to such
executive officer.

Stock Options    Our Company grants options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option Plan which has been amended and approved by our shareholders on several occasions, most
recently at our March 2005 annual meeting. Our Company has, in connection with certain of our business combinations, assumed the stock option plans of the acquired companies. All options outstanding under our Company’s previous plans and plans
assumed in business combinations continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of those grants. Under these plans, options are granted at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant and are generally exercisable
ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from date of grant. Options granted in fiscal years 2005, 2004 and 2003 expire seven years from date of grant. At September 25, 2005, September 26, 2004 and September 28, 2003,
approximately 3.9 million, 5.6 million and 2.2 million shares of our common stock, respectively, were available for future option grants.    We have a Company philosophy of “shared fate” which recognizes there is a community of interest among all of our stakeholders. We believe our plan, under which
all of our 33,000+ full-time and part-time Team Members are eligible for option grants, creates an ownership consciousness among our Team Members that aligns the interests of our Team Members with those of our shareholders. Through our broad-based
plan, our Team Members share in the risks and the rewards of our business. Approximately 93% of the options granted under the plan have been granted to Team Members who are not executive officers.    The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the options granted during
or for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2005 to each of our executive officers listed in the Summary of Executive Compensation set forth above.

   Director Compensation 
   For 2005, each of our non-employee directors received $4,791 for each Board
of Directors’ meeting attended and $2,258 for attendance via telephone. For each telephone Board of Directors meeting which was between one to two hours in length and in which a majority of directors participated, an $868 fee was paid. For each

Chair is $2,760 and the retainer for both the Compensation and Nominating & Governance Committee Chairs is $1,447. Each committee member received $868 for each Board of Directors Committee meeting attended in conjunction with a Board of
Directors meeting, and $3,473 for each Board of Directors Committee meeting attended in person apart from a Board of Directors meeting. The Lead Director and the Mergers and Acquisitions Director, both of whom are selected annually by the Board of
Directors, were paid quarterly retainers of $7,370 and $1,447 respectively. All directors were paid a quarterly retainer of $2,625.    In addition, directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in attending Board of Directors’ meetings. None of the non-employee directors received any
compensation from the Company other than as described above. Mr. Mackey, who is the only director who is also an employee of the Company, is not a member of any Board committees and does not receive any additional compensation for serving on
the Board of Directors.    Option Plan for
Outside Directors     Each newly elected director receives as of the date of
his or her initial election or appointment to the Board of Directors an option to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. In 2005, the Company added one new
director, Mr. Hassan, who received an option grant of 10,000 shares. If incumbent directors have attended at least two-thirds of the meetings of our Board of Directors held in the preceding year, they each receive an annual grant at an exercise
price equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant; in 2005 this option grant was 3,000 shares per director, granted on May 6, 2005. In addition to the above, in 2005 each director received a supplemental grant of 3,000
shares on September 15, 2005.    Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation     No member of our Board’s Compensation Committee has served as one of our officers or employees at any time. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any other company that has an executive
officer serving as a member of our Board of Directors. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Board’s Compensation Committee.
