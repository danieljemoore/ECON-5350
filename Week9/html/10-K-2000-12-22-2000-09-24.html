PART I

Item 1.   Business

Whole Foods Market, Inc. owns and operates the country's largest chain of
natural foods supermarkets. Our Company mission is to improve the health, well-
being, and healing of both people and of the planet. To achieve this mission, we
plan to continue to expand our retail operations to offer the highest quality
and most nutritious foods to more and more customers, helping them to live
healthier and more vital lives. Through our growth, we have had a large and
positive impact on the natural and organic foods movement throughout the United
States, helping lead the industry to nationwide acceptance over the last twenty
years.

We opened our first store in Austin, Texas in 1980 and as of September 24, 2000,
we operated 117 stores in 22 states plus the District of Columbia. Our sales
have grown rapidly through internal expansion, acquisitions and same store sales
growth, from approximately $92.5 million in fiscal year 1991 to approximately
$1.8 billion in fiscal year 2000, a compounded annual growth rate of
approximately 39%. Our stores currently average approximately 27,000 square feet
in size and approximately $17 million in annual sales. Sales per gross square
foot as of our most recent fiscal year end was approximately $660, which we
believe is higher than most conventional supermarkets or food retailers,
including competitors in the large-store segment of the natural foods industry.
Our stores are supported by regional distribution centers, bake houses,
commissary kitchens, a seafood processing facility, a produce procurement and
field inspection office, and a coffee roasting operation. We have the goal of
becoming a national brand synonymous with not just natural and organic foods,
but with being the best supermarket in every community in which we are located.

In fiscal year 2000, we merged Amrion, our direct marketing and nutritional
supplement manufacturing subsidiary, and WholeFoods.com, our Internet business,
to form WholePeople.com. In June 2000, WholePeople.com's Internet properties
were merged into Gaiam.com in exchange for common stock in Gaiam.com and the
remaining business was renamed NatureSmart. Subsequent to the end of the current
fiscal year, our Board of Directors adopted a plan to discontinue the business
of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements at NatureSmart.

The Natural Products Industry
According to a leading trade publication for the industry, natural products
sales have grown to over $28 billion in 1999, increasing 11% for the second year
in a row. The natural products we offer in our stores include:

 .  natural and organic foods and beverages,

 .  dietary supplements,

 .  natural personal care products,

 .  natural household goods, and

 .  educational products

Natural foods can be defined as foods which are minimally processed, largely or
completely free of artificial ingredients, preservatives and other non-naturally
occurring chemicals and as near to their whole, natural state as possible.
Organic is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances
biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on
the minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore,
maintain and enhance ecological harmony.

Sales growth for natural and organic foods is being driven by numerous factors
including:

 .  increasing consumer concern over the purity and safety of food due to the
   presence of pesticide residues, growth hormones, artificial ingredients and
   other chemicals, and genetically engineered ingredients;

 .  environmental concerns due to the degradation of water and soil quality; and

 .  healthier eating patterns driven by a better-educated populace whose median
   age is increasing each year.

                                       2
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Business Strategy
Whole Foods Market is the country's largest sales volume retailer of natural
products. We believe that much of our success to date is because we remain
uniquely mission driven. We are highly selective about what we sell, we believe
in providing an empowering work environment for our team members and we are
committed to sustainable agriculture.

Whole Foods. We obtain our products locally and from all over the world, often
from small, uniquely dedicated food artisans. We strive to offer the highest
quality, least processed, most flavorful and naturally preserved foods. We
believe that food in its purest state--unadulterated by artificial additives,
sweeteners, colorings and preservatives--is the best tasting and most nutritious
food available.

Whole People. We recruit the best people we can to become part of our team. We
empower them to make many operational decisions, creating a respectful workplace
where team members are treated fairly and are highly motivated to succeed. We
look for team members who are passionate about food but who are also well-
rounded human beings who can play a critical role in helping to build our stores
into profitable and beneficial parts of their communities.

Whole Planet. We believe companies, like individuals, must assume their share of
responsibility for our planet. On a global basis we actively support organic
farming--the best method for promoting sustainable agriculture and protecting
the environment and farm workers. On a local basis, we are actively involved in
our communities by supporting food banks, sponsoring neighborhood events,
compensating our team members for community service work, and contributing at
least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or products to not-for-
profit organizations.

Growth Strategy
Whole Foods Market's growth strategy is to expand through a combination of new
store openings and acquisitions of existing stores. We have a disciplined,
opportunistic real estate and acquisition strategy, opening or acquiring stores
in existing trade areas as well as new markets. Our new stores typically range
between 25,000 to 45,000 square feet and are located on premium real estate
sites. We have also grown through acquisitions, with approximately 50% of our
store base consisting of acquired stores. As the natural foods retailing
industry is highly fragmented and comprised of many smaller local and regional
chains, we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of smaller chains that
provide us access to desirable locations and markets as well as experienced team
members. Our historical store growth is summarized below:

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

(1) Stores acquired in pooling transactions are reflected as acquired in the
period in which the applicable transaction closed.

As of November 30, 2000, we had signed leases for over 20 stores averaging
approximately 34,000 square feet in size. We expect to open or acquire
approximately 15 to 20 stores per year, including relocations of existing
stores, in each of the next two fiscal years. We believe that going forward more
of our growth will come from developing new stores than from acquiring existing
stores.

Products
On average, our stores carry approximately 20,000 SKU's of food and non-food
products. We have a broad product selection with a heavy emphasis on perishable
foods designed to appeal to both natural foods and gourmet shoppers. Most of our
products are from natural food vendors; however, we do sell a limited selection
of conventional national brands that meet our quality goals.

                                       3
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Quality Goals. Our objective is to sell our customers the highest quality foods
available. We define quality in terms of nutrition, freshness, appearance and
taste and have the following product quality goals:

 .  Whole Foods. We evaluate each and every product that we sell.

 .  Natural. We feature foods that are free from artificial preservatives,
   colors, flavors and sweeteners.

 .  Taste. We are passionate about great tasting food and the pleasure of sharing
   it with others.

 .  Freshness. We are committed to foods that are fresh, wholesome and safe to
   eat.

 .  Organic. We seek out and promote organically grown foods.

 .  Wellness. We provide foods and nutritional products that support health and
   well being.

Product Categories. Our product categories include: produce, grocery, meat and
poultry, seafood, bakery, prepared foods, specialty (beer/wine/cheese),
nutritional supplements, body care, pet products, floral, household products and
educational products such as books.

Nutritional Supplements. Our nutrition departments offer a vast array of
vitamins, supplements, herbs and teas, homeopathic remedies and information on
alternative healthcare. The departments are staffed with team members who have
strong product knowledge. In an effort to make the departments easier for
customers to shop, the departments are organized based on product structure and
function categories such as Joint Health, Stress Reduction and Men's Health.
Along with many branded products, we also offer our own private label products
under the "Whole Foods" and "365" labels.

Private Label Products. Because of the relative lack of national brands within
the natural products industry, we have a unique private label opportunity. We
have taken advantage of this opportunity and have expanded our private label
offerings over the last several years. We now have four different lines of
products featuring over 1,000 SKU's. Our private label sales in grocery and
nutrition currently account for approximately 12% of our total sales in those
product categories. The "Whole Foods" label began in 1992 and markets "best of
class" premium and super premium products. We seek out artisan food producers,
small batch production and hand-tested recipes for products included in this
program. In 1997, we introduced a line of products under the "365" label which
emphasizes every day value products. These products meet our quality goals but
are less expensive than alternative products that we sell. In 1999, we
introduced a product line that appeals to our younger customers under the "Whole
Kids" label. After supplying our stores with specialty and organic coffees, teas
and brewing equipment for many years, Allegro Coffee Company was acquired by
Whole Foods Market in December of 1997.

Store Operations
Team Approach to Store Operations. We have promoted a strong Company culture
featuring a team approach to store operations which we believe is distinctly
more empowering of employees than that of the traditional supermarket. Our
stores employ between 31 and 400 team members who are organized into up to
eleven teams, each led by a team leader. Each team is responsible for a
different product category or aspect of store operations such as customer
service or the front-end which runs the customer checkout stations. We promote a
decentralized team approach to store operations in which many personnel,
merchandising and operating decisions are made by teams at the individual store
level. Because of our decentralized management structure, an effective store
team leader is critical to the success of the store. The store team leader works
closely with one or more associate store team leaders, as well as with all the
department team leaders, to operate the store as efficiently and profitably as
possible. Store team leaders are paid a salary plus an Economic Value Added
("EVA"(TM))-based bonus and are eligible to receive stock options.

We believe team members are inspired by work that provides them with a greater
sense of purpose and mission. For many team members, their job with us is an
extension of their personal philosophy and lifestyle. Many team members feel
they are contributing to the good of others by selling clean and nutritious
foods, by contributing to long-term sustainable agriculture and by promoting a
pesticide-free and healthier environment. We have a program that provides paid
time off to team members for working with qualified community service
organizations. For the past four years, Fortune magazine has selected us as one
of the "100 Best Companies to Work for in America."

                                       4
&lt;PAGE&gt;

We strive to create a Company-wide consciousness of "shared fate" by uniting the
self-interests of team members as closely as possible to the self-interests of
our shareholders. One way we reinforce this concept is through a gainsharing
program rewarding a team's labor productivity. We also encourage stock ownership
among team members through the following programs:

 .  Team Member Stock Option Plan. Team members are eligible for stock options
   through seniority, promotion or at the discretion of senior regional or
   national leadership.

 .  Team Member Stock Purchase Plan. Team members can purchase restricted stock
   at a discount through payroll deductions.

 .  Team Member 401(K) Plan. Whole Foods Market stock is an investment option
   within our Company 401(K) plan.

Store Description. We do not have a standard store design model. Instead, each
store's design is customized to fit the size and configuration of the particular
location and community in which it is located. We transformed food shopping from
a chore into a dynamic experience by building and operating stores with colorful
decor, well-trained team members, exciting product mixes, teams of in-store
chefs, ever-changing selections, samples, open kitchens, scratch bakeries, hand-
stacked produce, prepared foods stations and European-style charcuterie
departments. To further a sense of community and interaction with customers, our
stores typically include sit-down eating areas, customer comment boards and
centrally located information booths. We have "Take Action" centers for our
customers who want to be informed on important issues relative to environmental,
legislative, food safety and product quality issues that can directly affect our
customers' health and well being. In addition, some stores offer special
services such as massage, valet parking and home delivery. Whole Foods Market
stores play a unique role as a "third place"--besides the home and the office--
where people can gather, interact and learn while at the same time discovering
the many joys of eating and sharing food.

Site Selection. Each of our stores is generally located in a high-traffic
shopping area and is either freestanding or in a strip center. In selecting
store locations, we use an internally developed model to analyze potential
markets based on various criteria such as education levels, population density
and income levels. Approximately 95% of our existing stores are located in the
top fifty statistical metropolitan areas. We primarily seek to open large format
stores which range in size between 25,000 to 45,000 square feet and are located
on premier real estate sites, often in urban, high population locales. After we
have selected a target site, our site consultant does a comprehensive site study
and sales projection. Potential sites must also pass EVA hurdles. Stores
currently under development average approximately 34,000 square feet. In
addition, we opportunistically pursue smaller store sites which we believe can
achieve our sales and EVA targets.

New stores typically open approximately 12 to 24 months after a store lease is
signed. The required cash investment for new stores varies depending on the size
of the new store, geographic location, degree of work performed by the landlord
and complexity of site development issues. For the past three years, that has
ranged from approximately $3 million to $12 million, excluding new store
inventory of approximately $750,000, and pre-opening expenses have averaged
approximately $500,000.

Purchasing and Distribution
Our buyers purchase products for retail sale from regional wholesale suppliers
and vendors. Over the last few years, we have shifted the majority of our
purchasing operations from the store to the regional and national level. By
purchasing on a regional and national level, we are able to negotiate better
volume discounts with major vendors and distributors. We own and operate seven
regional distribution centers across the country. The largest of our regional
distribution centers, Texas Health Distributors in Austin, Texas, distributes
natural products to our stores in Texas, New Mexico, Colorado and Louisiana.

Our other regional distribution centers primarily distribute produce and our
private label products to our stores in their respective regions. In addition,
we own a seafood wharf, a produce procurement center, a specialty coffee roaster
and distributor and have established regional commissaries and bakehouses, all
of which distribute products to our stores.

                                       5
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Marketing
We spend less on advertising than conventional supermarkets, instead relying
primarily on word-of-mouth recommendations from our customers. We allocate about
half of our marketing budget to region-wide programs and the remainder to our
individual stores' marketing efforts. Our stores spend most of their marketing
budgets on store events such as taste fairs, classes, store tours and product
samplings. We encourage the adoption of a natural and organic lifestyle by
extending our customer education initiatives beyond the store to include
proactive public relations programs. To create goodwill and maintain a high
profile within its community, each store also has a separate budget for making
contributions to a variety of philanthropic and community activities. We
presently contribute at least 5% of our after-tax profits in the form of cash or
products to not-for-profit organizations.

Certain of our stores offer a loyalty card program, Whole Foods Rewards(TM),
which is designed to give our loyal customers meaningful savings and rewards
when they shop in our stores.

Customer Service
One of our core values as a Company is to satisfy and delight our customers. We
want to meet or exceed their expectations on every shopping trip. We know that
by doing so we turn customers into advocates for our business. Advocates do more
than shop with us, they talk about Whole Foods to their friends and others. We
want to serve our customers competently, efficiently, knowledgeably and with
flair. We generate greater appreciation and loyalty from our customers by
educating them about natural and organic foods, health, nutrition and the
environment through our in-store "Take Action" centers as well as on our
corporate web site at www.wholefoodsmarket.com which features a library of
                      ------------------------
information about environmental, legislative, food safety and product quality
issues.

Team Members
As of September 24, 2000, we had approximately 18,500 team members, including
approximately 15,400 full-time, 2,300 part-time and 800 seasonal team members.
We sponsor a partially self-insured health care benefits plan for participating
employees. We maintain a reserve for job-related injury claims rather than
subscribing to a workers' compensation insurance program for our team members in
Texas. All of our team members are eligible to receive stock options. While our
stores have been subject to informational pickets from time to time by certain
local retail clerks' and butchers' unions, none of our team members are
represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement. For the past
four years, Fortune magazine has selected Whole Foods Market as one of the "100
Best Companies to Work for in America."

Economic Value Added
In fiscal year 1999, we adopted an EVA management and incentive system. In its
simplest definition, EVA is equivalent to net operating profits after taxes
minus a charge for the cost of capital necessary to generate that profit. EVA
has become a foundation for improved business decisions across the Company, and
we are pleased with how well the program has been implemented to date.

One of our core strengths is our decentralized culture, where decisions are made
at the store level, close to the customer. This is one of our strongest
competitive advantages, and EVA is an excellent complement to our culture. We
believe that EVA is the framework that team members can use to help make
decisions that will create sustainable shareholder value. Rather than taking
decision-making authority away from local areas as we grow, we instead are
developing tools for our team members to use to help them make better decisions.
As a result, EVA is strengthening financial discipline in decisions made
throughout the Company. The impact is already being seen in how we look at
capital investments and make decisions that affect our operating results.

In fiscal year 2000, we integrated the EVA decision-making model throughout our
retail operations. We are using EVA extensively for capital investment
decisions, from evaluating new store real estate decisions to determining store
remodeling needs. Capital investments are evaluated through a series of EVA
analyses. We are turning down projects that do not add value to the Company in
the short or long term. Operating decisions in stores have also been enhanced by
the EVA decision-making model. Our emphasis is on EVA improvement, as we want to
challenge our teams to continue to innovate and grow in new ways. We believe
that opportunities always exist to increase sales and margins, and to lower
operating expenses in ways that benefit all of our stakeholders. We believe that
focusing on EVA improvement encourages continuous improvement of our business.

                                       6
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Over 250 leaders throughout the Company are now on EVA-based incentive plans, of
which the primary measure is EVA improvement. EVA-based plans cover our senior
executive leadership, regional leadership and the store leadership team in all
stores. We are excited about the progress that we have made with EVA in the
short time since we adopted the program and expect to continue to expand its use
throughout the Company in the coming years.

We believe that our extensive training on EVA, followed by the incentive plan
development and implementation, has blended EVA very well into our culture.
Using EVA, we believe that we have taken one of our strongest competitive
advantages and are making it even stronger.

Competition
Food retailing is a large, intensely competitive industry. While we primarily
compete within the smaller natural foods supermarket niche, on a broader scale
our competitors include local, regional and national conventional and specialty
supermarkets, smaller specialty stores as well as restaurants.

Natural and organic foods are one of the fastest growing segments of food
retailing today, and most supermarkets have begun offering at least a limited
selection of these products and may choose to expand their selection more
aggressively. We have found it works to our benefit for conventional
supermarkets to offer natural and organic products for two reasons. First, it
helps fulfill our Company mission of improving the health, well-being, and
healing of both people and of the planet.  Second, it helps create new customers
for us. As more people are exposed to the benefits of natural and organic
products, they are more likely to become Whole Foods Market customers as we are
the "category killer" for natural and organic products, offering what we believe
is the largest selection and most informed customer service at competitive
prices.

According to a leading trade publication, the natural products business remained
stable in 1999 as the percentage of sales in most sectors varied less than 1%
from those in 1998. Natural products retailers account for approximately 50% of
the overall market for natural products.

Strategic Relationships
We have entered into a strategic relationship with Gaiam, Inc., a lifestyle
company catering to customers who value the environment, personal development
and healthy living.  This relationship consists of our preferred equity
investment and minority common equity investment in the company's Internet
subsidiary, Gaiam.com, Inc., and commercial agreements which vary in scope from
a joint marketing agreement to the sale of products on co-branded sections of
the Gaiam.com Web site.

We believe that this investment and commercial arrangement is attractive for a
variety of reasons. First, our customers receive access to a wider range of
desirable products and services. Second, we are able to generate revenue from
the strategic partners because we help them sell to our customer base. Third, we
have the opportunity to participate in the future success of Gaiam and Gaiam.com
as a result of our ownership interest. We believe that our strategic partners
are also well served as a result of the opportunity to grow their customer base
quickly and build brand recognition.

Government and Public Affairs
Our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and
administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions
regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal employment,
minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some stores, alcoholic
beverages.

The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising
of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the
Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the
Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"), the United States Department of
Agriculture ("USDA") and the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). The
composition and labeling of nutritional supplements are most actively regulated
by the FDA under the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act
("FFDC Act"). The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with respect to
dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and by the
Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act. We believe we are in material
compliance with product labeling requirements.

                                       7
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Margaret Wittenberg, our Vice President of Governmental and Public Affairs, has
served on numerous government boards and industry committees to create and
strengthen the USDA's proposed National Organic Standards, counseling the USDA
and the EPA on pesticide tolerance levels, controlling the use and labeling of
Genetically Modified Organisms ("GMOs") in the food chain and preserving marine
fisheries.

The USDA released the National Organic Standards in December 2000. The National
Organic Standards will facilitate interstate commerce and marketing of fresh and
processed foods that are organically produced, and will help provide assurance
to our customers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards.

Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results
We wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause
our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward-
looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, news releases, reports, proxy statements, registration
statements and other written communications, as well as oral forward-looking
statements made from time to time by representatives of our Company.  These
risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those risks described
below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we
currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. The
cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our
business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to be materially
adversely affected.

Our Growth is Dependent on New Store Openings and Acquisitions

Our strategy is to expand through a combination of new store openings and
acquisitions of existing stores. Successful implementation of this strategy is
contingent on numerous conditions, some of which are described below, and there
can be no assurance that our expansion strategy can be successfully executed.

Our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or
acquire new stores in existing and new markets and to operate these stores
successfully. Our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations,
and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites. We may not
be able to timely open new stores or operate them successfully. In addition, we
may not be able to successfully hire and train new team members, or integrate
those team members into the programs and policies of our Company. We may not be
able to adapt our distribution, management information and other operating
systems to adequately supply products to new stores at competitive prices so
that we can operate the stores in a successful and profitable manner.

There can be no assurance that we will continue to grow through acquisitions.
For the acquisitions that we do make, we may not be able to successfully
integrate those businesses into our operations and support systems, or the
operations of acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the introduction
of our decentralized operational approach.

We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Quarterly Operating Results

Our quarterly operating results could fluctuate for many reasons, including
losses from new stores, variations in the mix of product sales, price changes in
response to competitive factors, increases in merchandise costs, possible supply
shortages and potential uninsured casualty losses. In addition, our quarterly
operating results may fluctuate significantly as the result of the timing of
acquisitions, the timing of new store openings, and the range of operating
results generated from newly opened stores.

                                       8
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be
materially impacted by the timing of new store openings. Effective the beginning
of fiscal year 2000, we charged our new store pre-opening costs to expense as
incurred in accordance with Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-5 "Reporting on the
Costs of Start-up Activities" issued by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants ("AICPA"). In fiscal year 1999 and prior years, we
capitalized pre-opening costs as incurred and subsequently expensed such amounts
in the quarter of the location opening.

We May Not Be Able to Complete the Sale of NatureSmart as Planned

We have accounted for and presented the NatureSmart business of manufacturing
and direct marketing of nutritional supplements as discontinued operations in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We intend to dispose of the
NatureSmart business through the sale of our ownership of its operating units
and assets. If we are unable to complete the sale in the expected timeframe, we
may need to continue to operate and finance NatureSmart, and, consequently, our
borrowing capacity for retail operations could be affected and management's
focus could be diverted from our retail operations.

We have recorded a loss on disposition of the NatureSmart business totaling
approximately $24 million, representing the writedown to estimated net
realizable value of the business being discontinued, costs associated with the
planned disposal, and estimated loss from operations of the discontinued
business through the expected date of disposition, net of income tax benefit.
If we are unable to complete the sale of the NatureSmart business in the
expected timeframe, or if the estimates used in determining the loss on disposal
change significantly, our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows could be adversely affected.

Capital Needed for Expansion May Not be Available

The acquisition of existing stores, the opening of new stores and the
development of new production and distribution facilities require significant
amounts of capital. In the past, our growth has been funded primarily through
proceeds from public offerings, bank debt, private placements of debt, and
internally generated cash flow. These and other sources of capital may not be
available to us in the future. In addition, restrictive covenants which may be
imposed by our lenders may restrict our ability to fund our growth.

Increased Competition May Have an Adverse Effect on Profitability

Our competitors currently include other natural foods supermarkets, conventional
and specialty supermarkets, other natural foods stores, small specialty stores
and restaurants. These businesses compete with us in one or more product
categories. In addition, traditional and specialty supermarkets are expanding
more aggressively in marketing a broad range of natural foods, thereby competing
directly with us for products, customers and locations. Some of these potential
competitors have been in business longer or have greater financial or marketing
resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to sourcing,
promoting and selling their products. Increased competition may have an adverse
effect on profitability as the result of lower sales, lower gross profits,
and/or greater operating costs such as marketing.

The sales of nutritional supplements, nutriceuticals and other fitness and
health-related products are highly competitive, and we expect to face continued
competitive pressure in the future.

Legal Proceedings Could Materially Impact Our Results

From time to time we are party to legal proceedings including matters involving
personnel and employment issues, intellectual property, and other proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business. Although not currently anticipated
by management, our results could be materially impacted by the decisions and
expenses related to such proceedings.

We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People Are Harmed By the
Products We Sell

There is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food
safety. We believe that many customers choose to shop our stores because of
their interest in health, nutrition and food safety. Although we have
intensified our retail food safety procedures, we believe that our customers
hold us to a higher standard than conventional supermarkets. The real or
perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in product
liability claims, the settlement or outcome of which might have a material
adverse effect on our operations.

                                       9
&lt;PAGE&gt;

The Loss of Key Management Could Negatively Affect Our Business

We are dependent upon a number of key management and other team members. If we
were to lose the services of a significant number of key team members within a
short period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
We do not maintain key person insurance on any team member. Our continued
success is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified team
members to meet our future growth needs. We face intense competition for
qualified team members, many of whom are subject to offers from competing
employers. We may not be able to attract and retain team members as necessary to
operate our business.

Information Picketing May Impact Our Sales

Our new and existing stores have from time to time been subjected to
informational picketing and negative publicity campaigns by members of various
local trade unions. These informational pickets and campaigns may have the
effect of lowering the sales volumes of new or existing stores.

Acquired Operations May Experience Integration Issues

By acquiring many new stores and certain manufacturing type businesses in the
last several years, we have materially increased the scope of our operations by
entering new markets and increasing the number of our stores we operate. There
can be no assurance that comparable store sales of acquired stores will increase
to or be maintained at the level achieved by our existing stores. Additionally,
the operations of acquired stores may be adversely affected as a result of the
introduction of our decentralized team approach to store operations, or the
response of customers to the changes in operations and merchandising mix that we
may make. The integration of acquired operations into our operations will
require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily detract
attention from our day-to-day business.

Unfavorable Changes in Government Regulation Could Harm our Business

Our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and
administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with
provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, equal
employment, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food and, in some
stores, alcoholic beverages. Our new store openings could be delayed or
prevented or our existing stores could be impacted by difficulties or failures
in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses.

The manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising
of products are subject to regulation by various federal agencies including the
FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the USDA and the EPA. The composition and labeling of
nutritional supplements are most actively regulated by the FDA under the
provisions of the FFDC Act. The FFDC Act has been revised in recent years with
respect to dietary supplements by the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act and
by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act.

Released by the USDA in December 2000, the National Organic Standards will
facilitate interstate commerce and marketing of fresh and processed food that is
organically produced and will provide an assurance to our customers that such
products meet consistent, uniform standards. Compliance with these standards
might pose an unbearable burden on some of our suppliers that may cause a
disruption in some of our product offerings.

We cannot predict the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or
applications, or determine what effect either additional government regulations
or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state
and local regulatory schemes would have on our business in the future. They
could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet new
standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be
reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the
properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or scientific
substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on
our results of operations and financial condition.

                                       10
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Our Stock Price is Volatile

The market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation
in response to various market factors and events. These market factors include
variations in our earnings results, changes in earnings estimates by securities
analysts, publicity regarding us, our competitors, the health food industry
generally, new statutes or regulations or changes in the interpretation of
existing statutes or regulations affecting the health food industry
specifically, sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market
or the perception that such sales could occur and other factors.

In addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and
volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance
of particular companies. These market fluctuations also may adversely affect the
market price of our common stock. Volatility in the price of our common stock,
changes in prevailing interest rates and changes in perception of our
creditworthiness may in the future adversely affect the price of our convertible
subordinated debentures.

Information System Upgrades or Integrations May Disrupt Our Operations or
Financial Reporting

We continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems. We have
completed a number of acquisitions in recent years, and the information systems
of some of the acquired operations have not been fully integrated with our
information systems. Although we do not anticipate any disruption in our
operations or financial reporting as a result of system upgrades or system
integrations, there can be no assurance that such disruption will not occur or
that the desired benefits from the system upgrades will be realized.

We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights

We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law
and internal procedures and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual
property. There can be no assurance that our intellectual property rights can be
successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or
challenged. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our
products may be produced or sold do not protect our intellectual property rights
to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Failure to protect our
proprietary information could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Self-Insured Benefits Plan Claims Could Materially Impact Our Results

We provide partially self-insured, voluntary team member benefits plans that
provide, among other benefits, health care benefits to participating team
members. The plans are designed to provide specified levels of coverage, with
excess insurance coverage provided by a commercial insurer. Although not
currently anticipated by management, our results could be materially impacted by
claims and other expenses related to such plans.

Item 2.   Properties

At September 24, 2000, we operated 117 stores in twenty-two states and the
District of Columbia. We own the New Orleans, Berkeley and Atlanta store
locations. We also own a building in Austin, Texas which houses one of our
stores, the corporate headquarters and a bookstore. The underlying property is
leased from a third party under a ground lease which has a base term of twenty
years with ten options to renew for five years each. We also own manufacturing,
distribution warehousing and office facilities in Thornton, Colorado and an
undeveloped property in Westminster, Colorado that are associated with
discontinued operations and are actively being marketed. All other stores,
distribution centers, bakehouses and administrative facilities are leased, with
expiration dates ranging from 1 to 40 years. The Company has options to renew
most of its leases with renewal periods ranging from 5 to 50 years. The
following table shows the number of Company stores by state and the District of
Columbia as of September 24, 2000:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

The Company has a lease with the bookstore at its building in Austin, Texas.
Certain officers of the Company are also shareholders of the bookstore in which
they own a combined approximately 13% of the outstanding stock. We believe that
the terms of the lease with the bookstore are on terms no less favorable to the
Company than could have been negotiated with an independently owned retailer.
This is partially based on an appraisal of the lease by an independent appraisal
firm. The income from this lease is not material to the Company's operations.

Item 3.   Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company is involved in lawsuits that we consider to be in
the normal course of business which have not resulted in any material losses to
date.

Item 4.   Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

Not applicable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

The Company had approximately 1,374 record holders of its common stock as of
November 30, 2000.

The Company intends to retain any earnings for use in its business and therefore
does not anticipate paying any cash dividend in the foreseeable future. The
Company's present bank credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants
that include the prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock.

Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations

General
Whole Foods Market opened its first store in Texas in 1980 and has expanded its
operations to 117 stores as of September 24, 2000 both by opening new stores and
acquiring existing stores from third parties. We operate in one reportable
segment, natural foods supermarkets. All of the Company's operations are
domestic. Our results of operations have been and will continue to be materially
affected by the timing and number of new store openings. New stores may incur
operating losses for the first one or two years of operations. Our results of
operations are reported on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last
Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 are 52-week years. Fiscal
year 2001 is a 53-week year.

In November 2000, the Company announced that it had adopted a plan to dispose of
the NatureSmart (formerly Amrion) business of manufacturing and direct marketing
of nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business and related
net assets have been recorded as discontinued operations in the consolidated
financial statements for all years presented. The following discussion and
analysis refer only to continuing operations.

                                       16
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Sales
Sales from continuing operations increased 23.2%, 14.1% and 24.7% in fiscal
years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Sales for all years shown reflect
increases due to new stores opened and acquired and comparable store sales
increases of approximately 8.6%, 7.7% and 11.0% in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. Sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in
the fifty-third full week after the store was opened or acquired. Comparable
store sales increases generally resulted from an increase in the number of
customer transactions and slightly higher average transaction amounts,
reflecting an increase in market share as the stores mature in a particular
market. These increases are due to such factors as improvements in overall store
execution and increased sales of private label products.

Gross Profit
Gross profit consists of sales less cost of goods sold and occupancy costs plus
contribution from non-retail distribution and food preparation operations. The
Company's gross profit from continuing operations as a percentage of sales was
34.5%, 34.0% and 33.3% in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. These
increases reflect increased national buying, category management and private
label initiatives, which lower the cost of product purchased on a national
basis. Additionally, continued improvement by new stores with respect to product
procurement, merchandising and controlling spoilage has contributed to these
increases in gross profit. In all years, gross profit margins were also
positively affected by margin improvements as stores mature. Relative to other
stores in a region, gross profit margins tend to be lower for new stores and
increase as stores mature, reflecting lower spoilage as volumes increase, as
well as increasing experience levels and operational efficiencies of the store
teams. Gross profit margins were positively affected in all years by the
increased percentage of sales in certain regions and in certain departments such
as prepared foods where we achieve higher gross profits.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations as a
percentage of sales were 28.1% in both fiscal years 2000 and 1999 and 27.4% in
fiscal year 1998. Fiscal year 2000 selling, general and administrative expenses
reflect higher direct store expenses as a percentage of sales at new and
acquired stores added over the last year. In fiscal year 1999 we increased the
number of administrative and support personnel at the regional and national
levels to support current and planned growth incurred additional costs related
to the implementation of new management information systems and procedures
required to address our potential Year 2000 issues. Whole Foods Market has
historically been able to expand without a significant increase in general and
administrative costs.

Pre-opening and Relocation Costs
Pre-opening costs include hiring and training personnel, supplies, and certain
occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new store and facility openings and
are incurred primarily in the thirty days prior to a new store opening.
Relocation costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated
depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities and other
related expenses. The AICPA issued SOP 98-5 "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up
Activities" in April 1998. SOP 98-5 requires costs of start-up activities and
organization costs to be expensed as incurred. We adopted SOP 98-5 effective the
beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. In accordance with SOP 98-5,
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2000 we have reported the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle, a one-time charge totaling approximately
$375,000 after taxes, representing start-up costs capitalized at September 26,
1999. In fiscal year 1999 and prior years, we capitalized pre-opening costs as
incurred and subsequently expensed such amounts in the quarter of the location
opening. Whole Foods Market developed and opened seventeen stores in fiscal year
2000, nine stores in fiscal year 1999 and nine stores in fiscal 1998. Of these,
three stores were relocations in fiscal year 2000, one store in fiscal year 1999
and three stores in fiscal year 1998. Pre-opening and relocation costs were
approximately $10.5 million $5.9 million and $4.0 million in fiscal years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

Amortization Expense
Amortization expense consists primarily of costs associated with the
amortization of excess of cost over net assets acquired and non-competition
agreements. Amortization expense from continuing operations as a percentage of
sales was 0.3% in fiscal year 2000 and 0.2% in both fiscal years 1999 and 1998.

                                       17
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Asset Disposal Costs
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999, we recognized asset disposal
costs totaling approximately $5.9 million. Costs associated with the disposal of
accounting and distribution software which was replaced with the implementation
of new financial software totaled approximately $2.8 million. Costs associated
with other hardware and software disposals totaled approximately $3.1 million
and consisted of the writeoffs of certain Year 2000 non-compliant or obsolete
hardware and certain software under development that we determined would not be
placed in service. Substantially all activities related to the asset disposals
were completed in fiscal year 1999.

Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of costs related to the Company's convertible
subordinated debentures, senior notes and bank line of credit, net of
capitalized interest associated with new store development and internally
developed software. Interest expense related to our Company's borrowings, net of
amounts capitalized, was approximately $15.1 million, $8.2 million and $7.7
million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The annual increases
in net interest expense are due primarily to additional amounts outstanding
under the Company's bank line of credit.

Investment and Other Income (Loss)
During fiscal year 2000, we determined that recent events and circumstances,
including the apparent inability of the investee to obtain additional funding,
had caused a decline in value that was other than temporary of our preferred
stock investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. As a result of this decline in
value, in fiscal year 2000 we recognized a $10 million pre-tax loss associated
with the writeoff of the Company's preferred stock investment in American
WholeHealth, Inc. Investment and other income (loss) for fiscal year 2000 also
includes interest, rental and other income totaling approximately $2.0 million.
Investment and other income (loss) for fiscal years 1999 and 1998 consists
primarily of interest income earned on a short-term corporate bond portfolio and
a prime money market portfolio.

Income Taxes
Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was approximately
44.6%, 39.0% and 37.1% for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Our
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2000 was higher than in prior years due to
the writeoff of the Company's $10 million investment in American WholeHealth,
Inc. and a corresponding valuation allowance that was established on the related
deferred tax asset. Excluding the impact of this investment loss, our effective
rate on income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2000 was approximately
39.5% The lower income tax rate for fiscal year 1998 reflects the elimination of
the valuation allowance of approximately $7.8 million previously provided on net
operating loss carryforwards assumed in the Fresh Fields acquisition. At
September 24, 2000, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards totaling
approximately $47.9 million. We consider it more likely than not that all net
operating loss carryforwards will be utilized.

Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates
Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates represents the Company's share of
losses of companies in which we have investments that give us the ability to
exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee. Equity in
losses of unconsolidated affiliates for fiscal year 2000 totaled approximately
$14.1 million and consisted primarily of the Company's share of WholePeople.com
Internet operations losses, including WholePeople.com's investment losses on
Internet-related preferred and common stock investments totaling approximately
$12.4 million.

Discontinued Operations
In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the NatureSmart
business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements.
Accordingly, the NatureSmart business has been accounted for and presented as
discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. In fiscal year
2000, we recorded a loss on disposition of the NatureSmart business totaling
approximately $24 million, representing the writedown to estimated net
realizable value of the business being discontinued, costs associated with the
planned disposal, and estimated loss from operations of the discontinued
business through the expected date of disposition, net of income tax benefit.
Net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2000 was approximately $9.4
million. Net income from discontinued operations in fiscal years 1999 and 1998
was approximately $2.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively.

                                       18
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Business Combinations
In February 2000, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Natural
Abilities, Inc., which operated three natural foods supermarkets in the Sonoma
County, California area, in exchange for approximately $25.7 million in cash
plus the assumption of certain liabilities. This transaction was accounted for
using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to
net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill totaling approximately $23.9
million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.

In April 1999, we acquired the outstanding stock of Nature's Heartland, Inc.,
which operated four natural foods supermarkets in the greater Boston
metropolitan area, in exchange for approximately $24.5 million in cash. This
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the
purchase price was allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated
fair values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill of
approximately $13.5 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years.

In December 1997, we acquired Merchant of Vino, which operated four
gourmet/natural foods stores and two specialty wine and gourmet food shops in
the Detroit area, in exchange for approximately 1 million shares of Company
common stock. Also in December 1997, the Company acquired Allegro Coffee
Company, a specialty coffee roaster and distributor based in Boulder, Colorado,
in exchange for approximately 175,000 shares of Company common stock. These
acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method.
Transaction and other merger-related costs associated with these acquisitions
totaled approximately $1.7 million.

                                       19
&lt;PAGE&gt;

Quarterly Results
The first quarter consists of 16 weeks, the second and third quarters each
consist of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consists of 12 or 13 weeks. Fiscal
years 2000 and 1999 are 52-week years with the fourth quarters consisting of 12
weeks. Because the first quarter is longer than the remaining quarters and
contains both the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, it typically represents a
larger share of our annual sales from existing stores. We adopted SOP 98-5,
which requires costs of start-up activities to be expensed as incurred,
effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. In fiscal year
1999 and prior years, we capitalized pre-opening costs as incurred and
subsequently expensed such amounts in the quarter of the location opening.
Quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations have been and may be
materially impacted by the timing of new store openings. We believe that the
historical pattern of quarterly sales and income as a percentage of the annual
total may not be indicative of the pattern in future years. The following tables
set forth selected quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of operations
information for the fiscal years ended September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999

Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2000 include writedown of
investments totaling approximately $22.4 million in continuing operations and
approximately $24.0 million after-tax loss on disposal of the NatureSmart
business of manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements.
Quarterly results have been reclassified to reflect discontinued operations and,
accordingly, differ from those previously reported in our quarterly reports on
Form 10-Q for fiscal year 2000 with regard to certain line items. Net income is
not affected by the reclassifications. Results for the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 1999 include asset disposal costs totaling approximately $5.9 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999, our working capital was
approximately $9.1 million and negative $3.9 million, respectively, and the
ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 1.06 to 1 and 0.97 to 1,
respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $124.2
million, $116.6 million and $87.5 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998,
respectively.

On February 7, 2000, we amended our bank credit agreement to increase our
revolving line of credit to up to $160 million through June 28, 2002. Under
terms of the amended agreement, on June 29, 2000 we subsequently increased our
revolving line of credit to up to $195 million through June 28, 2002. This
credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including the
prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock. The credit agreement
also contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain
financial ratios as defined in the agreement. All outstanding amounts borrowed
under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate
or the Eurodollar rate plus a premium. Commitment fees ranging from 0.20% to
0.30% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 24,
2000, approximately $137 million was drawn and approximately $54 million was
available under the agreement. At September 26, 1999, approximately $49 million
was drawn and approximately $44 million was available under the agreement. At
November 30, 2000, approximately $157 million was drawn and approximately $34
million was available under the agreement. The average interest rate on amounts
outstanding under this agreement at September 24, 2000 was approximately 7.73%.
During 1998 we issued zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures for
approximately $115 million. The issue price of the debentures resulted in an
effective yield to maturity of 5 percent. The principal amount of the debentures
at maturity is approximately $308.8 million. All amounts outstanding under the
Company's line of credit were repaid during the second quarter of fiscal year
1998 with proceeds from the issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures.
The debentures are convertible at the option of the holder, at any time on or
prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. Debentures
may be redeemed at the option of the holder on March 2, 2003, March 2, 2008 or
March 2, 2013 for a purchase price equal to issue price plus accrued original
issue discount to such dates. The Company also has outstanding approximately
$34.3 million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at 7.29% payable
quarterly. Principal on the senior notes is payable in annual installments of
approximately $5.7 million through May 16, 2006. The Board of Directors has
authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50 million in outstanding shares of
Company common stock. During fiscal years 2000 and 1999, we repurchased 429,000
and 608,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock for an aggregate cost of
approximately $13.5 million and $18.9 million, respectively. Net cash provided
by financing activities was approximately $77.9 million, $36.4 million and $61.0
million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

Whole Foods Market's principal capital requirements have been the funding of the
development or acquisition of new stores and, to a lesser extent, the resultant
increase in working capital requirements. We estimate that cash requirements to
open a new store will range from approximately $3 million to $12 million (after
giving effect to any landlord construction allowance). This excludes new store
inventory of approximately $750,000, a portion of which is financed by our
vendors. As of November 30, 2000, we had signed leases for over 20 stores
averaging approximately 34,000 square feet in size. We expect to open or acquire
approximately 15 to 20 stores per year, including relocations of existing
stores, in each of the next two fiscal years. We will incur additional capital
expenditures in fiscal year 2001 in connection with ongoing equipment upgrades
and resets at existing stores and continued development of management
information systems. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$180.7 million, $159.8 million and $118.2 million in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively. We expect that planned expansion and other anticipated
working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be funded by cash
generated from operations and long-term debt. We continually evaluate the need
to establish other sources of working capital and will seek those considered
appropriate based upon the Company's needs and market conditions.

Adoption of Accounting Standards
The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") in June 1998 as amended by SFAS No. 138, which was
issued in June 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes reporting standards for derivative
instruments and hedging activities that require an entity to recognize all
derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at fair value and is effective for
financial statements issued for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning
after June 15, 2000. If certain conditions are met, a derivative may be
specifically designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value,
variable cash flow, or foreign currency of a recognized asset or liability or
certain other transactions and firm commitments. We will adopt SFAS No. 133 in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 will not
have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Disclaimer on Forward Looking Statements
Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in
this analysis are forward looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties, including but not limited to general business conditions, the
timely development and opening of new stores, the impact of competition, and the
other risks detailed herein and from time to time in our filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any
obligation to update forward-looking statements.

Item 7(a)  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company is exposed to interest rate changes and changes in the market value
of its investments. We are not a party to any derivative arrangement and do not
use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.

Interest Rate Risk. The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk from
changes in interest rates, which may affect its financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. In seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate
fluctuations, we attempt to manage our exposures through ongoing evaluation of
the composition of our long-term debt.

Our line-of-credit borrowings do not give rise to significant fair value risk
because these borrowings have maturities of less than three months. At September
24, 2000, approximately $137 million was outstanding under our line of credit
agreement at an average interest rate of approximately 7.73%. A 100 basis point
change in interest rate would affect interest expense on the line of credit
borrowings by approximately $1.4 million on an annual basis based on the
outstanding balance at September 24, 2000. At September 26, 1999 approximately
$49 million was outstanding under our line of credit agreement at an average
interest rate of approximately 7.01%. Our senior unsecured notes and
subordinated convertible debentures have fixed interest rates, and the fair
value of these instruments is affected by changes in market interest rates. The
senior unsecured notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 7.29% and have an
outstanding balance of $34.3 million and $40.0 million at September 24, 2000 and
September 26, 1999, respectively. At September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999,
the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by
approximately $260,000 and $400,000, respectively. The zero coupon subordinated
convertible debentures have an effective yield to maturity of 5% and an
outstanding balance of approximately $130.8 million and $124.4 million at
September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999, respectively. At September 24, 2000
and September 26, 1999, the carrying amount of the convertible debentures
exceeded the estimated fair value by approximately $9.6 million and $22.7
million, respectively. Should interest rates increase or decrease, the estimated
fair values of the senior notes and the zero coupon subordinated debentures
would decrease or increase accordingly.

Investment Risk. We have investments in both common and preferred equity
securities of Gaiam.com, a non-public Internet company, for business and
strategic purposes. These investments are accounted for using the equity method.
The common equity securities have a carrying value of approximately $4.8 million
at September 24, 2000. The preferred equity securities have a carrying value of
approximately $4.8 million at September 24, 2000. At September 26, 1999, we had
common equity investments totaling approximately $3.6 million and preferred
equity investments totaling approximately $20 million, both accounted for under
the cost method. During fiscal year 2000, we contributed the common equity
investment and $10 million of the preferred investment to our WholePeople.com
affiliate. During fiscal year 2000, the Company and WholePeople.com recognized
impairment losses totaling $20 million on the preferred investments and
approximately $2.4 million on the common equity investment.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

In January 2000, the Company and certain venture capital investors formed
WholePeople.com, Inc. ("WholePeople.com"). The Company contributed its Internet
and supplements businesses in consideration of the issuance of WholePeople.com's
Preferred Stock, and the venture capital investors contributed cash in
consideration of the issuance of WholePeople.com's Class A Common Stock. In June
2000, WholePeople.com contributed its Internet business to a subsidiary of
Gaiam, Inc. ("Gaiam"), which was immediately merged into a newly formed
subsidiary corporation, Gaiam.com, Inc. ("Gaiam.com"). WholePeople.com and Gaiam
own 49.9% and 50.1%, respectively, of the outstanding common stock of Gaiam.com.
Jirka Rysavy, Gaiam's chairman and majority stockholder, was elected to our
Board of Directors. Mr. Mackey was elected to the Gaiam board of directors. Mr.
Rysavy and Mr. Mackey are each a director and executive officer of Gaiam.com.
The Company does not exercise control over Gaiam.com and therefore has accounted
for its investment in Gaiam.com common stock using the equity method.

In a separate transaction in June 2000, WholePeople.com purchased from Gaiam the
outstanding preferred shares of Gaiam.com for $6.0 million. These shares are
redeemable at their face amount upon the occurrence of an initial public
offering of Gaiam.com.

In addition, Infocenter, Inc., a company controlled by Mr. Rysavy, acquired from
a subsidiary of WholePeople.com in June 2000, for a nominal purchase price,
certain assets not contributed to Gaiam.com including in-store kiosks, trade
show booths and $500,000 cash and a $3.0 million note obligation.

Separately, the Company entered into a marketing agreement with Gaiam in June
2000. Under the agreement, the Company agreed (i) to permit the distribution of
the Gaiam catalog within our stores or by mail to our customers, (ii) to permit
Gaiam to test market the sale of Gaiam products within certain of our stores and
(iii) to allow Gaiam.com to purchase our products for resale on the Gaiam.com
website. Gaiam agreed to permit the distribution of the Company's promotional
materials, such as new store openings, to Gaiam's customers. Gaiam and the
Company also agreed to provide their standard employee product discounts to the
other's employees.

John P. Mackey and Glenda Flanagan, executive officers of the Company, own
approximately 13% in the aggregate of BookPeople, Inc. which leases facilities
from the Company. The lease provides for an aggregate annual minimum rent of
approximately $391,000, which we received in rental income in fiscal year 2000.

Retention Agreements
Since November 1991, the Company has entered into Retention Agreements with
certain executive officers of the Company or its subsidiaries which provide for
certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment other than for
cause after a "Triggering Event." A Triggering Event includes a merger of the
Company with and into an unaffiliated corporation if the Company is not the
surviving corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's
assets. The benefits to be received by the executive officer whose employment is
terminated after a Triggering Event occurs include receipt of his or her annual
salary through the one-year period following the date of the termination of
employment and the immediate vesting of any outstanding stock options granted to
such executive officer.

Whole Foods Market, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
Whole Foods Market, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Whole Foods
Market, Inc. and subsidiaries ("Company") as of September 24, 2000 and September
26, 1999 and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in
the three-year period ended September 24, 2000. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Whole Foods Market,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the fiscal years in
the three-year period ended September 24, 2000, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for pre-opening costs in fiscal year 2000.

Whole Foods Market, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Fiscal years ended September 24, 2000, September 26, 1999 and September 27, 1998

(1) Corporate Organization
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Whole Foods
Market, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Company"). All significant majority-owned
subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Definition of Fiscal Year
We report our results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on
the last Sunday in September. Fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 are 52-week
years.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, we consider all
highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be
cash equivalents.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
We account for investments in affiliated entities in which we have the ability
to exercise significant influence, but not control, of an investee, generally an
ownership interest of the voting stock of between 20% and 50%, using the equity
method of accounting. Accordingly, the Company's share of the investee's
earnings or loss is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations in "Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates." Our investments
in equity-method investees are included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets in "Long-term investments." The portion of our investment in an equity-
method investee that exceeds our share of the net assets of the investee, if
any, is amortized as a reduction to income (currently over a period of five
years). The excess cost amount is included in " Long-term investments" on the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, and the amortization is included in
"Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates" in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations.

We classify our investments in equity securities that have readily determinable
fair values and are not accounted for under the equity method and our
investments in debt securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses, net
of the related tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are excluded from
earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity until
realized. A decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale security below
cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in
carrying amount to fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new
cost basis of the security is established.

All other investments, which consist of equity investments which do not have
readily determinable fair values or for which we do not have the ability to
exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method of
accounting and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in
"Long-term investments." Dividends and other distributions of earnings from cost
method investees, if any, are included in income when declared.

During fiscal year 2000, we determined that recent events and circumstances,
including the apparent inability of the investee to obtain additional funding,
had caused a decline in value that was other than temporary of our preferred
stock investment in American WholeHealth, Inc. As a result of this decline in
value, in fiscal year 2000 we recognized a $10 million pre-tax loss associated
with the writeoff of the Company's preferred stock investment in American
WholeHealth, Inc. which is included in investment and other income (loss) in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable,
trade accounts payable, accrued payroll, bonus and employee benefits, and other
accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short maturity of those
instruments. The carrying value of notes payable to banks approximates fair
value due to variable interest rates charged on these notes. Marketable
securities are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included as
a component of shareholders' equity until realized. The fair value of long-term
investments accounted for under the cost method is estimated, where practicable,
based on prices recently paid for shares in those companies.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, continued
The fair value of convertible subordinated debentures is estimated using quoted
market prices. The fair value of senior unsecured notes is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows at the rates currently available to us for
similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.

Carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments other
than those for which carrying amounts approximate fair values as noted above are

Inventories
We value our inventories, both retail and wholesale, at the lower of cost or
market. Cost is principally determined by the last-in, first-out ("LIFO")
method. The manufactured inventories of Allegro Coffee Company are determined by
the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. The excess of estimated current costs
over LIFO carrying value was approximately $4.5 million at both September 24,
2000 and September 26, 1999. Balances of inventories are as follows (in
thousands):
                                                             2000    1999

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and
amortization. We provide depreciation of equipment over the estimated useful
lives (generally 3 to 15 years) using the straight-line method. We provide
amortization of leasehold improvements on the straight-line method over the
shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the
related leases. Costs related to a projected site determined to be
unsatisfactory and general site selection costs which cannot be identified with
a specific store location are charged to operations currently.

Acquired Leasehold Rights
We amortize acquired leasehold rights to rent expense over the remaining lease
term using the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization of acquired
leasehold rights at September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999 totaled
approximately $3.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

Excess of Cost Over Net Assets Acquired
We amortize excess of cost over net assets acquired over 20 to 40 years using
the straight-line method. Accumulated amortization of excess of cost over net
assets acquired at September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999 totaled
approximately $10.5 million and $8.3 million, respectively. We evaluate the
carrying value of the excess of cost over net assets acquired periodically in
relation to such factors as the occurrence of a significant event, the operating
performance of each acquired subsidiary and the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows of the underlying business. If the sum of the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the excess of cost
over net assets acquired, a loss is recognized for the difference.

                                                                     (continued)

Other Assets
Other assets include non-competition agreements, trademarks and certain costs
associated with the issuance of debt. Non-competition agreements and debt
issuance costs are amortized over the life of the related agreement using the
straight-line method. We amortize trademarks over 40 years using the straight-
line method. Accumulated amortization included in other assets at September 24,
2000 and September 26, 1999 totaled approximately $7.3 million and $6.1 million,
respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of
We evaluate long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such
assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue for sales of our products at the point of sale.

Pre-opening and Relocation Costs
Pre-opening costs include costs associated with hiring and training personnel,
supplies and certain occupancy and miscellaneous costs related to new locations.
The AICPA issued SOP 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities" in
April 1998. SOP 98-5 requires costs of start-up activities and organization
costs to be expensed as incurred. We adopted SOP 98-5 effective the beginning of
the first quarter of fiscal year 2000. In fiscal year 1999 and prior years, we
capitalized pre-opening costs and expensed such amounts in the quarter of the
location opening. In accordance with SOP 98-5, in the first quarter of fiscal
year 2000 we reported the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle,
a one-time charge totaling approximately $375,000 after taxes, representing
start-up costs capitalized at September 26, 1999. The adoption of SOP 98-5 did
not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Relocation
costs consist of moving costs, remaining lease payments, accelerated
depreciation costs and other costs associated with replaced facilities and other
related expenses.

Advertising
We charge advertising costs to expense as incurred. Advertising expense related
to continuing operations for fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 was approximately
$11.2 million, $10.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively.

Income Taxes
We use the asset and liability approach which accounts for deferred income taxes
by applying statutory tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date to
differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax assets and
liabilities are adjusted in income to reflect changes in tax laws or rates in
the period that includes the enactment date.

Stock-Based Compensation
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 ("SFAS
No. 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," we continue to apply
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees" and related interpretations in accounting for our stock
option grants. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense relative to our
team member stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock
option.

Earnings (Loss) per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during the fiscal period. Diluted earnings (loss) per
share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus,
where applicable, the additional common shares that would have been outstanding
as a result of the conversion of dilutive options and convertible debt.

                                                                     (continued)

Comprehensive Income
The Company's comprehensive income in fiscal years 1999 and 1998 consisted of
net income and changes in unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities,
net of tax. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of
shareholders' equity and comprehensive income.

Segment Information
We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131") in
fiscal year 1999. We operate in one reportable segment, natural foods
supermarkets. All of the Company's operations are domestic.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. We use estimates when accounting for depreciation and
amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, employee benefit plans, income
taxes, reorganization reserves, disposal of discontinued operations and
contingencies.

Reclassifications
Where appropriate, we have reclassified prior years' financial statements to
conform to current year presentation.

(3) Property and Equipment
Balances of major classes of property and equipment are as follows (in
thousands):

2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Property and equipment includes approximately
$2.3 million, $1.8 million and $0.7 million of interest capitalized during
fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

&lt;/TABLE&gt;

On February 7, 2000, we amended our bank credit agreement to increase our
revolving line of credit to up to $160 million through June 28, 2002. Under
terms of the amended agreement, on June 29, 2000 we subsequently increased our
revolving line of credit to up to $195 million through June 28, 2002. This
credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants, including the
prohibition of the payment of dividends on common stock. The credit agreement
also contains certain affirmative covenants including maintenance of certain
financial ratios as defined in the agreement. At September 24, 2000 the Company
was in compliance with the debt covenants. All outstanding amounts borrowed
under this agreement bear interest at our option of either a defined base rate
or the Eurodollar rate plus a premium. Commitment fees ranging from 0.20% to
0.30% of the undrawn amount are payable under this agreement. At September 24,
2000, approximately $137 million was drawn and at September 26, 1999,
approximately $49 million was drawn under the agreement. The average interest
rate on amounts outstanding under this agreement at September 24, 2000 was
approximately 7.73%. The amounts available to the Company under this line of
credit were effectively reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling
approximately $3.9 million and $6.9 million at September 24, 2000 and September
26, 1999, respectively.

During the second quarter of fiscal year 1998, we issued a private offering
under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of zero coupon
convertible subordinated debentures with no sinking fund requirement and a
scheduled maturity date of March 2, 2018. The debentures were subsequently
registered. The offering resulted in gross proceeds to the Company of
approximately $115 million. The issue price of the debentures results in an
effective yield to maturity of 5 percent. The principal amount of the debentures
at maturity is approximately $308.8 million. The debentures are convertible at
the option of the holder, at any time on or prior to maturity, unless previously
redeemed or otherwise purchased. The debentures have a conversion rate of 5.320
shares per $1,000 principal amount at maturity, initially representing a
conversion price of approximately $70 per share of common stock, or
approximately 1,643,000 shares. The debentures may be redeemed at the option of
the holder on March 2, 2003, March 2, 2008 or March 2, 2013 at the issue price
plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption. Subject to certain
limitations, at our option, we may elect to pay this purchase price in cash,
shares of common stock or any combination thereof. The debentures may also be
redeemed in cash at the option of the holder if there is a change in control at
the issue price plus accrued original discount to the date of redemption.
Subsequent to March 2, 2003, at our option, we may redeem the debentures for
cash, in whole or in part, at redemption prices equal to the issue price plus
accrued original discount to the date of redemption. The debentures are
subordinated in the right of payment to all existing and future senior
indebtedness.

We also have outstanding approximately $34.3 million of senior unsecured notes
that bear interest at 7.29% payable quarterly. Principal on the senior notes is
payable in annual installments of approximately $5.7 million through May 16,
2006. The notes contain certain affirmative and negative covenants, including
maintenance of certain financial ratios as defined in the agreement. At
September 24, 2000 and September 26, 1999, the Company was in compliance with
the debt covenants.

(5) Leases

The Company is committed under certain capital leases for rental of equipment
and certain operating leases for rental of facilities and equipment. These
leases expire or become subject to renewal at various dates from 2001 to 2040.
Rental expense charged to operations under operating leases for fiscal years
2000, 1999 and 1998 totaled approximately $47.1 million, $38.4 million and $34.8

Minimum rentals for operating leases do not include certain amounts of
contingent rentals which may become due under the provisions of leases for
retail space. These agreements provide that minimum rentals may be increased
based on a percent of annual sales from the retail space. During fiscal years
2000, 1999 and 1998, we paid contingent rentals of approximately $2.2 million,
$2.0 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Certain officers of the Company own
approximately 13% of a business which leases facilities from the Company under a
lease that commenced in fiscal year 1995. Rental income from this lease totaled
approximately $0.4 million during fiscal years 2000 and 1999 and approximately
$0.5 million during fiscal year 1998.

The Company has provided a valuation allowance of approximately $7.2 million for
deferred tax assets associated with capital loss carryforwards for which
management has determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Management believes that it is more likely than not that
the Company will fully realize the remaining deferred tax assets in the form of
future tax deductions based on the nature of these deductible temporary
differences and a history of profitable operations. As of September 24, 2000,
the Company had net operating loss carryforwards totaling approximately $47.9
million that will expire in 2020.

(7) Business Combinations
Natural Abilities
In February 2000, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Natural
Abilities, Inc., which operated three natural foods supermarkets in the Sonoma
County, California area, in exchange for approximately $25.7 million in cash
plus the assumption of certain liabilities. This transaction was accounted for
using the purchase method and, accordingly, the purchase price has been
allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the
date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill totaling approximately
$23.9 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 20 years.
Pro forma results of operations are not presented due to the immaterial effect
of the acquired company's results on consolidated results of operations.

Nature's Heartland
In April 1999, we acquired the outstanding stock of Nature's Heartland, Inc.,
which operated four natural foods supermarkets in the greater Boston
metropolitan area, in exchange for approximately $24.5 million in cash. This
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and, accordingly, the
purchase price was allocated to net assets acquired based on their estimated
fair values at the date of acquisition. This allocation resulted in goodwill of
approximately $13.5 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years.

Merchant of Vino
In December 1997, we acquired Merchant of Vino, which operated four
gourmet/natural food supermarkets and two specialty wine and gourmet food shops
in the greater Detroit metropolitan area, for approximately 1 million shares of
Company common stock. The acquisition was accounted for using the pooling-of-
interests method. Due to the immateriality of the financial statements of the
acquired entity to the Company's consolidated financial statements, financial
information for the periods prior to the acquisition was not restated. An
adjustment to decrease retained earnings by approximately $1.8 million was
recorded to include results of operations of the acquired entity prior to the
combination in these consolidated financial statements. Revenue and results of
operations of the acquired entity for the period from September 29, 1997 through
the date of acquisition are not material to the combined results. Transaction
and other merger-related costs associated with the acquisition of Merchant of
Vino totaled approximately $1.1 million.

Allegro Coffee Company
In December 1997, we acquired Allegro Coffee Company, a specialty coffee roaster
and distributor based in Boulder, Colorado, for approximately 175,000 shares of
Company common stock. The acquisition was accounted for using the pooling-of-
interests method. Due to the immateriality of the financial statements of the
acquired entity to the Company's consolidated financial statements, financial
information for the periods prior to the acquisition was not restated. An
adjustment to increase retained earnings by approximately $1.2 million was
recorded to include results of operations of the acquired entity prior to the
combination in these consolidated financial statements. Revenue and results of
operations of the acquired entity for the period from September 29, 1997 through
the date of acquisition are not material to the combined results. Transaction
and other merger-related costs associated with the acquisition of Allegro Coffee
Company totaled approximately $0.6 million.

(8) Investments in Internet Operations
Effective January 14, 2000, we contributed our Amrion, Inc. and WholeFoods.com,
Inc. subsidiaries to WholePeople.com, Inc., in exchange for 14,530,000 shares of
convertible preferred stock of WholePeople.com. Net assets of the contributed
subsidiaries totaled approximately $46.1 million. Concurrent with the preferred
stock issuance, WholePeople.com issued 3,125,732 shares of Class A common stock
of WholePeople.com to unaffiliated investors (the "Investors") at $6.3985 per
share, representing an aggregate purchase price of $20.0 million.
WholePeople.com issued an additional 968,977 shares of Class A common stock to
the investors at $6.3985 per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of
$6.2 million. Together with the initial investment of $20.0 million and
subsequent Class A common stock issuance of $5.0 million during the third
quarter to the Investors, the Investors' total investment was $31.2 million for
4,876,142 shares of Class A common stock.

Effective June 30, 2000, WholePeople.com restructured its Internet operations by
merging its Internet business into a subsidiary of Gaiam, Inc., a newly formed
company named Gaiam.com, Inc. WholePeople.com received a 49.9% interest in the
common stock of Gaiam.com. Pursuant to the restructuring, the WholePeople.com
web site was replaced by the Gaiam.com web site. WholePeople.com recognized a
pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $24.3 million, which consisted of
the write-off of its Internet web site, expenses associated with the transfer of
Internet operations to Gaiam.com and severance costs. The remaining business of
manufacturing and direct marketing of nutritional supplements formerly known as
Amrion was renamed NatureSmart. In addition to these restructuring charges, in
fiscal year 2000 WholePeople.com incurred other pre-tax operating losses from
Internet operations totaling approximately $9.5 million. WholePeople.com also
recognized pre-tax investment losses on Internet-related preferred stock and
common stock investments totaling approximately $12.4 million. In a separate
transaction in June 2000, WholePeople.com purchased from Gaiam the outstanding
preferred shares of Gaiam.com for $6.0 million. These shares are redeemable at
their face amount upon the occurrence of an initial public offering of
Gaiam.com.

We accounted for our investment in WholePeople.com Internet operations using the
equity method. In applying the equity method, losses were allocated to the stock
classes in accordance with the terms of the common and preferred stockholders'
agreements. Accordingly, effective January 14, 2000, the Internet operating
results of WholePeople.com were not reflected in our consolidated results of
operations as long as positive common stock equity was available in
WholePeople.com. Equity in losses in unconsolidated affiliates in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements includes after-tax losses
totaling approximately $14.1 million incurred in WholePeople.com Internet
operations after common equity had been reduced to zero. We subsequently
acquired the common stock of WholePeople.com. As a result, we obtained deferred
tax assets associated with net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards
totaling approximately $19.2 million and $7.2 million, respectively. The Company
assumed ownership of the Gaiam.com preferred and common equity investments upon
adoption of the plan to sell NatureSmart. We have accounted for our investment
in Gaiam.com common stock using the equity method and have recognized earnings
of Gaiam.com in proportion to our ownership percentage. The Company's investment
in Gaiam.com is not material in relation to its financial position or results of
operations and therefore summarized financial information for Gaiam.com is not
presented.

(9) Discontinued Operations
In November 2000, the Company adopted a formal plan to sell the NatureSmart
(formerly Amrion, Inc.) business of manufacturing and direct marketing of
nutritional supplements. Accordingly, the NatureSmart business is accounted for
and presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. We have recorded a net loss on disposition of the
NatureSmart business totaling approximately $24 million, representing the
writedown to estimated net realizable value of the business being discontinued,
costs associated with the planned disposal and the estimated loss from
operations of the discontinued business through the expected date of
disposition, net of income tax benefit of approximately $8.4 million.

                                                                     (continued)

(10) Shareholders' Equity
Treasury Stock
The Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase up to $50
million in outstanding shares of Company common stock. During fiscal years 2000
and 1999, we repurchased 429,000 shares and 608,000 shares, respectively, of our
common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $13.5 million and $18.9
million, respectively. In fiscal year 2000, we reissued shares from treasury at
average cost for certain options exercised. During fiscal year 2000,
approximately 281,000 shares were reissued from treasury for a total of
approximately $8.8 million.

Preferred Stock Purchase Rights
On September 22, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of
one Right to purchase preferred stock ("Right") for each outstanding share of
Company common stock to shareholders of record at the close of business on
October 4, 1999. Each right initially entitles the registered holder to purchase
from the Company a fractional share consisting of one one-thousandth of a share
of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, at a
purchase price of $225 per fractional share, subject to adjustment. The Rights
generally will not become exercisable until ten days after a public announcement
that a person or group has acquired 15% or more of Company common stock (thereby
becoming an "Acquiring Person") or the commencement of a tender or exchange
offer that would result in an Acquiring Person (the earlier of such dates being
called the "Distribution Date"). Rights will be issued with all shares of
Company common stock issued from the record date to the Distribution Date. Until
the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by the certificates
representing Company common stock and will be transferable only with our common
stock. Generally, if any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each
right, other than Rights beneficially owned by the Acquiring Person (which will
thereupon become void), will thereafter entitle its holder to purchase, at the
Rights' then current exercise price, shares of our common stock having a market
value of two times the exercise price of the Right. If, after there is an
Acquiring Person, and the Company or a majority of its assets is acquired in
certain transactions, each Right not owned by an Acquiring Person will entitle
its holder to purchase, at a discount, shares of common stock of the acquiring
entity (or its parent) in the transaction. After there is an Acquiring Person,
the Company's Board of Directors may, under certain circumstances, exchange
shares of our common stock or other securities for each Right not held by an
Acquiring Person. At any time until ten days after a public announcement that
the Rights have been triggered, our Company will generally be entitled to redeem
the Rights for $.01 and to amend the rights in any manner. Certain subsequent
amendments are also permitted. The Rights expire on September 22, 2009.

The computation of diluted earnings (loss) per share does not include
approximately 1.6 million shares of common stock related to the zero coupon
convertible subordinated debentures at the end of fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
1998 and options to purchase approximately 1.3 million shares, 1.5 million
shares and 1.0 million shares of common stock at the end of fiscal years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively, because to do so would be antidilutive.

Team Member Stock Option Plans
Our Company grants options to purchase common stock under our 1992 Stock Option
Plans, as amended. Under these plans, options are granted at an option price
equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant and are generally
exercisable ratably over a four-year period beginning one year from date of
grant. Options granted in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 expire seven years
from date of grant. Our Company has, in connection with certain of our business
combinations, assumed the stock option plans of the acquired companies. All
options outstanding under our Company's previous plans and plans assumed in
business combinations continue to be governed by the terms and conditions of
those grants. At September 24, 2000, September 26, 1999 and September 27, 1998
approximately 0.3 million, 0.5 million and 1.4 million shares of our common
stock, respectively, were available for option grants.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;/TABLE&gt;

At September 26, 1999 and September 27, 1998, approximately 1.5 million and 1.1
million outstanding options, respectively, were exercisable. The weighted
average exercise price for outstanding exercisable options was $29.79 and $16.10
at September 26, 1999 and September 27, 1998, respectively.

As required by SFAS No. 123, we have determined pro forma net income and net
income per common share as if compensation costs had been recognized based on
the fair value of the options granted to team members. The fair value of stock
option grants has been estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
multiple option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

                                               2000     1999     1998
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected dividend yield                        0.00%    0.00%    0.00%
Risk-free interest rate                        6.13%    5.23%    5.63%
Expected volatility                           54.21%   54.89%   53.72%
Expected life, in years                        3.46     3.40     3.37
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The weighted average estimated fair values at grant date of team member stock
options granted during fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $18.58, $13.91 and
$30.03, respectively. Had we recognized compensation cost based on the fair
value of stock options granted to team members at grant date as determined using
the Black-Scholes option valuation model described above consistent with SFAS
No. 123, net income (loss) and diluted income (loss) per share would have
changed to the pro forma amounts shown below (in thousands, except per share
data):

                                                     2000     1999     1998
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net income (loss):
 As reported                                     $ (4,831)  42,155   45,395
 Pro forma                                        (15,558)  30,175   36,437

Diluted income (loss) per share:
 As reported                                     $  (0.18)    1.54     1.64
 Pro forma                                          (0.57)    1.10     1.31
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above pro forma disclosures may not be representative of the effects on net
income and net income per common share in future years because they do not take
into consideration pro forma compensation expense related additional stock
options that may be granted in future years.

                                                                     (continued)

(12) Team Member Benefit Plans
Team Member Stock Purchase Plan
Our Company offers a team member stock purchase plan to all full-time team
members with a minimum of 400 hours of service. Under this plan, participating
team members may purchase our common stock each fiscal quarter through payroll
deductions. Participants in the stock purchase plan may elect to purchase
unrestricted shares at 100 percent of market value or restricted shares at 85
percent of market value on the purchase date. Participants are required to hold
restricted shares for two years before selling them. We issued approximately
12,000, 15,000 and 8,000 shares under this plan in fiscal years 2000, 1999 and
1998, respectively.

Team Member 401(k) Plan
Our Company offers a team member 401(k) plan to all team members with a minimum
of one year of service and 1,000 service hours in the plan year. Matching
contributions under this plan, determined at the Company's discretion, totaled
approximately $0.6 million, $1.1 million and $0.8 million in fiscal years 2000,
1999 and 1998, respectively. Matching contributions in fiscal years 2000 and
1999 were made in Company common stock purchased in open market transactions
totaling approximately 14,000 shares and approximately 32,000 shares,
respectively, and approximately 13,000 newly-issued shares in fiscal year 1998.

(13) Asset Disposal Costs
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999, we recognized asset disposal
costs totaling approximately $5.9 million. Costs associated with the disposal of
accounting and distribution software which was replaced with the implementation
of new financial software totaled approximately $2.8 million. Costs associated
with other hardware and software disposals totaled approximately $3.1 million
and consisted of the writeoffs of certain Year 2000 non-compliant or obsolete
hardware and certain software under development that we determined would not be
placed in service. Substantially all activities related to the asset disposals
were completed in fiscal year 1999.

(14) Commitments and Contingencies
Our Company provides partially self-insured, voluntary team member benefits
plans which provide, among other benefits, health care benefits to participating
team members. The plans are designed to provide specified levels of coverage,
with excess insurance coverage provided by a commercial insurer. Our exposure
related to claims associated with unreported cases or underestimated future
costs associated with known cases for which our Company is partially
self-insured at September 24, 2000 has been estimated based on management's
review of claims outstanding at fiscal year end, claims reported subsequent to
fiscal year end and management's knowledge of the typical length of time from
date of occurrence to date of reported claim.

The Company is a party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the
ordinary course of business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of
the Company's litigation matters, management does not believe that the outcome
of any of those matters will have a material adverse effect on the our
consolidated financial position, operating results or cash flows.
